a bm inkább em ? - Rp.

<i>…You know like I was saying man. So I walk in there 
and my brother’s around and I end up kissing my own brother. You know.
That’s far out man.
That’s what I’ll say, it’s fucked up.
You know what they say man, like father like son.
You said it best brother.</i>

intro:C,D,F,G

C
In the car I just can't wait,
G                F
to pick you up on our very first date
C
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
G                  F
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
C
Do you like my stupid hair?
G                    F
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
C
I'm too scared of what you think
G                   F
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

C        em            am        F     G
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
C        em            am        F     G
Honest, let's make this night last forever
C        em            am        F     G
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
C        em            am        F     G
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

intro

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room

Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that i'm probably gonna miss

break:C,E,F,G

end on:C
