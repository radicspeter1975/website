[Intro]
A | A | A | A |
  
[Verse 1]
 A
Tell me that you're never gonna miss somebody like you miss me
 A
Tell me that you're never gonna hurt somebody like you hurt me
       Bm  E          A
I was cha-sing new horizons
           Bm  E           A
Wide open spa-ces got me crying
  
[Chorus]
D                          A                  E
I know I let you go and I told you to let it be
D                            A                     E
I know I cut the rope but I don't want you to go free
  
[Verse 2]
  A
Promise that you're never gonna wake up in an ordinary bed
   A
Swear you're never gonna tell a soul about the shit that I said
          Bm  E         A
The L.A. sky--y never changes
           Bm  E                 A
But in my min--nd, there's no escaping
  
[Chorus]
D                          A                  E
I know I let you go and I told you to let it be
D                            A                     E
I know I cut the rope but I don't want you to go free
  
[Bridge]
 A
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday night
      Bm  E
No reply--y
         A
Why, oh why?
  
[Chorus]
D                          A                  E
I know I let you go and I told you to let it be
D                            A                     E
I know I cut the rope but I don't want you to go free
D                          A                  E
I know I let you go and I told you to let it be
D                            A                     E
I know I cut the rope but I don't want you to go free
