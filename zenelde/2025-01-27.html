[Verse]
            Dmaj7
Who'll ever win?
                        Gmaj7
Gee, you're just so ephemeral
            Dmaj7
Go back for new
                    Gmaj7
For new in vain, it failed
 
[Chorus]
Dmaj7                    D/C
Singing on the famous street
          Gmaj7
I want to love (a love...) me
D                          D/C
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
                  Gmaj7
It's so much more brighter than the sun is to me
 
[Verse]
            Dmaj7
He's a hustler
                                Gmaj7
It's a role, he'll never make a suit
           Dmaj7
Hang on to this
                                Gmaj7
So stay and spin and fail and fail
 
            Dmaj7
Who'll ever win?
                        Gmaj7
Gee, you're just so ephemeral
            Dmaj7
Go back for new
                    Gmaj7
For new in vain, it failed
 
[Chorus]
Dmaj7                      D/C
Singing on the famous street
          Gmaj7
I want to love (a love...) me
D                            D/C
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
                  Gmaj7
It's so much more brighter than the sun is to me
 
Dmaj7                              D/C
The chill must itch in my soul (Heaven or Las Vegas)
Gmaj7
That's like any old playing card
               Dmaj7                  D/C
It must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas (Heaven or Las Vegas)
                                        Gmaj7
It's why it's more brighter than the sun is to me
 
[Bridge]
Em                 A
Furthermore, let's blast it off
    D/C         Gmaj7
I'm dizzy so I go, another bit it off
    Em              A
Come fantasy, for a carnival
    D/C          Gmaj7
I'm empty before our wedding
 
[Solo]
Em A C G
Em A C G
 
[Chorus]
Dmaj7                           D/C
Singing on the famous street
          Gmaj7
I want to love (a love...) me
Dmaj7                              D/C
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
                  Gmaj7
It's so much more brighter than the sun is to me
 
Dmaj7                             D/C
The chill must itch in my soul (Heaven or Las Vegas)
Gmaj7
That's like any old playing card
               Dmaj7                        D/C
It must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas (Heaven or Las Vegas)
                                        Gmaj7
It's why it's more brighter than the sun is to me
 
[Bridge]
Em                 A
Maybe there, while you was rail
        D/C                Gmaj7
I'll go in and seize your heart and be personal
Em           A
I suspect I'm singing to you a tune
    C Cadd9                     G
And still you find the beat and sing it to you soon
 
[Solo]
Em A C G
Em A C G A
