Want some whiskey in your water, sugar in your tea?
What's all these crazy questions, they're asking me?
This is the craziest party, there could ever be
Don't turn on the lights, cause I don't wanna to see

Chorus:
     G5             B5    C5     C#5  D5
Mama told me not to come
     G5             B5    C5     C#5  D5
Mama told me not to come            she said
     G5            B5      C5     C#5  
That ain't the way to have fun        son

That ain't the way to have fun

Open up the window, let some air into this room
I think I'm almost choking, from the smell of stale perfume
And the cigarette you're smoking, bout to scare me half to death
Open up the window let me catch my breath

Mama Told Me Not To Come
Mama told me not to come
She Said! That ain't the way to have fun - son!
That ain't the way to have fun - son! son! son!

The radio is blasting and someone's knocking at the door
I'm looking at my girlfriend, she just passed out on the floor
I've seen so many things, I ain't never seen before
Don't know what it is, but I don't wanna see no more

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come - Mama told me She said She said
That ain't the way to have fun no no no!
That ain't the way to have fun - son!
Mama told me
Mama told me
Mama told me
Mama told me
Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
That ain't the way to have fun - son!
That ain't the way to have fun - That what she say, she say!
That ain't the way to have fun - no!
That ain't the way to have fun - Mama told me
Mama told me
Mama told me
Mama told me
Mama told me
She told me not to come - Mama told me not to come!
That ain't no way to have fun - That ain't no way to have fun
That ain't no way to have fun - son!
That ain't no way to have fun - ah no no!
(maybe I should have listened)
