(A)          E                       A
My Name is Jim, and I drink a lot of gin
             E                       A 
Down by the river, just fucking with my liver

I get my money from centrelink
I don't shower and I really stink
Neither does my wife
She hasn't showered since she was five
B                               A 
Go down to the pub in the afternoon
I tell my wife that I'll be home soon
B                               A 
I can't really afford my smokes
A  Bb B 
Cause I bet it all on the pokes

My Name is Jim, and I drink a lot of gin
Down by the river, just fucking with my liver
My Name is Jim, and I drink a lot of gin
Down by the river, just fucking with my liver

I have ten fucking kids
And they all give me the shits
Being dicks and carrying on
To calm them down, I give them a bong

The love for my kids just isn't there
The only love I have is for the welfare
Me eldest dropped out before year one
He says working at Maccas is a lot of fun

My Name is Jim, and I drink a lot of gin
Down by the river, just fucking with my liver
My Name is Jim, and I drink a lot of gin
Down by the river, just fucking with my liver

My wife left me the other day
She took the kids but forced me to pay
But ya know it's all ok
Cause I'm fucking her sister today

My Name is Jim, and I drink a lot of gin
Down by the river, just fucking with my liver
My Name is Jim, and I drink a lot of gin
Down by the river, just fucking with my liver
