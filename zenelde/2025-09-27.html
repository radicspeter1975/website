<i>Ya-ha!
...the garage and water from the sprinkler.
It also left a man's decapitated body,
Lying on the floor next to his own severed head.
A head which at this time has no name.
I KNOW HIS NAME.</i>
 
          [B][A][B]
Here I am!         
          [E]            [D]  [A]       [B][A][B]   [E]    [D] [A]
I'm the master of your destiny,            ha, ha!
         [G]
I am the one, the only one,
           [A]
I am the God of Kingdom Come,
          [B]                                   [C#]
Gimme the Prize! Just gimme the prize!
 
                 [B][A][B]
Give me your kings,

Let me squeeze them in my hands,                  h-h-hey!
            [B][A][B]
Your puny princes,
                    [E] [D]      [A]  [B][A][B]   [E]    [D] [A]
Your so-called leaders of your land.
 
                  [F#]           [B]
I'll eat them whole before I'm done,
                 [F#]                           [B]
The battle's fought and the game is won,
           [G]
I am the one, the only one,
           [A]
I am the God of Kingdom Come,
            [B][A][B]   [E]  [D] [A]
Gimme the Prize!

There's no escape from my authority                     - didn't I tell you?
