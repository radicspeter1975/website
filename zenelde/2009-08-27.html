Verse 1&2
 
A
The sun is shining
                    C#m
We should be making hay
                        Bm           D
But we're dead from the waist down
                   A
Like in Californ-i-a
 
A
Victory is empty
                       C#m
There are lessons in defeat
                        Bm           D
But we're dead from the waist down
                       A        A7
We are sleeping on our feet
 
Bridge
                                    Dm
We stole the songs from birds in trees
                           F#m
Bought our time on easy street
                           Bm
Now our paths they never meet
                                  Dm
We chose the court and flatter greed
               F#m
ego disposability
                             Bm       E
I caught a glimpse, and it's not me
 
Chorus
             Bm      D
Make hay not war
             A       F#m
Make hay not war
             Bm
Make hay not war
                   D
Or else we're done for
                       A
And we're D from the W down
 
Verse 3
A
There's no contracts binding
                      C#m
No bad scene beyond repair
                              Bm            D
But when you're dead from the waist down
                             A        A7
You're too far gone to even care
 
Bridge 2
                                    Dm
We stole the songs from birds in trees
                        F#m
Bought our time on easy street
                         Bm
Now our paths they never meet
                               Dm
We chose the court and flatter greed
               F#m
ego disposability
                             Bm        E
I caught a glimpse, and it's not me
 
Chorus

Make hay not war

Or else we're done for

And we're D from the W down
