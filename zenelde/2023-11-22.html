A                           Am                  F                   C         G D
Every single night in bed a black cross says perhaps you're getting better
A                              Am            F                C         G D
I'd like to thank you for your efforts to promote what really matters
A                                Am         F            C            G D
Whenever you're about to fall, remember this: it's not a news flash
A                                 Am        F           C
Don't pretend to know it all, but go ahead, call it a cocoon crash

       Bm            Em
What I really see in you
           F                   Dm
Is nothing like the things you do
           Am          G           F
As you are doing them, right now
              G              Am
But you would really love to win
              G              F
To become the air as well as trash
          G               C
Is to get rid of all your skin
    G/B   Am          G          Em
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash
                 F
Call it what you will
G                C
Call it what you will
    G/B   Am          G D  A
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash

A                       (Am)              (F)            (C)       G D
Suddenly the ego that I used to have's no bigger than an eyelash
A                          Am               F                    C
Clearly I remember someone told me 'Hold on tight, here's your cocoon crash'

       Bm            Em
What I really see in you
           F                   Dm
Is nothing like the things you do
           Am          G           F
As you are doing them, right now
              G              Am
But you would really love to win
              G              F
To become the air as well as trash
          G               C
Is to get rid of all your skin
    G/B   Am          G          Em
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash
                 F
Call it what you will
G                C
Call it what you will
    G/B   Am          G          Em
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash
                 F
Call it what you will
G                C G/B Am G Em F
Call it what you will, yeah (you will)
G                C G/B Am G Em F
Call it what you will, yeah (you will)
