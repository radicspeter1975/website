<pre>
We were tight
But it falls apart
As silver turns to blue
Waxing with a candlelight
And burning just for you
Allocate your sentiment
And stick it in a box
I've never been an extrovert
But i'm still breathing

Some tried to do me ache
Some tried to do me ache
Some tried to do me ache
It's what i'm afraid of
Some tried to do me ache
It's what i'm afraid of

With hindsight
I was more than blind
Lost without a clue
Thought I was getting carat gold
And what I got was you
Stuck inside the circumstances
Lonely at the top
I've always been an introvert
Happily bleeding

Some tried to do me ache
Some tried to do me ache
Some tried to do me ache
It's what i'm afraid of
Some tried to do me ache
It's what i'm afraid of

Four, seven, two, three, nine, eight, five
I gotta breathe to stay alive
And one, four, two, night, seven, eight
Feels like i'm gonna suffocate
Fourteen, sixteen, twenty-two
This skin that turns to blister blue
Shoulders toes and knees
I'm Thirty six degrees
Shoulders toes and knees
I'm Thirty six degrees
Shoulder toes and knees
I'm Thirty six degrees
Shoulders toes and knees
I'm Thirty six degrees
