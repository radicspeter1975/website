fél hanggal mélyebben (D=C#)

[Intro]
D5 D5 F#m F#m
D5 D5 F#m F#m
 
[Verse 1]
D5                            F#m
Bring me home to this house of many days
     F#m    E      D5                      F#m
Just lay me on the floor hard and cool as slate
    F#m    E       D5                          F#m
You know I love it more and more than before I ran away
   F#m      E   D5                              F#m
It triggers off so many hurts hurtful words and broken plates, I .....    
 
[Chorus 1]
E                 F#m
lied to,  Now I'm fuzzy
          E
I've been lied to
 
[Verse 2]
D5                                        F#m
All and all the world is small enough for both of us
   F#m    E      D5                      F#m
To meet upon the interstate waiting on a train
    F#m       E         D5                             F#m
And just when those big arms lift up fall in love with no time to say it, I..
 
[Chorus 2]
E                  F#m
liked to,  Now I'm fuzzy
          E                 F#m
I've been lied to, Now I'm fuzzy, Fuzzy now
 
[Solo 1]
D5 D5 F#m F#m x2
 
[Verse 3]
D5                             F#m
Here we are in our car driving down the street
      F#m     E     D5                           F#m
We're looking for a place to stop have a bite to eat
   F#m    E     D5                          F#m
We hunger for a bit of faith to replace the fear
   F#m    E     D5                                F#m
We water like a dead bouquet does no good does it dear, I ...
 
[Chorus 3]
E                 F#m
lied to,  Now I'm fuzzy
           E                 F#m
We've been lied to, Now I'm fuzzy, Fuzzy now
E
lied to,
