   [Verse 1]
Dm                                      D5       Dm  D5
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
Dm                                        D5     Gm
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Gm                                 Dm     D5   Dm
Who will dance on the floor in the round
           D5      Gm                                    Dm
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

   [Verse 2]
Dm                                          D5           Dm  D5
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused the scene
Dm                                               D5        Gm
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Gm                                 Dm
Who will dance on the floor in the round

   [Pre Chorus]
Bb                    Dm
People always told me be careful what you do
Bb                                      Dm
don't come around breaking young girls' hearts
Bb                        Dm
And mother always told me be careful who you love
Bb                                       A
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
A7sus4
(Hey Hey Hey)
 
   [Chorus]
Dm                      D5    D
Billie Jean is not my lover
D5                                         Gm
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
Gm                    Dm
But the kid is not my son
Dm                Gm                         Dm
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
 
   [Verse 3]
Dm                                              D5      Dm  D5
For forty days and for forty nights The law was on her side
Dm                                             D5       Gm
But who can stand when she's in demand' Her schemes and plans
Gm                                   Dm     D5  Dm
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
           D5        Gm                                 Dm
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Dm
 (Do think twice)
 
   [Verse 4]
Dm                                          D5     Dm  D5
She told my baby to dance to three then she looked at me,
Dm                                         D5       Gm
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', eyes was like mine
Gm                                 Dm
So we dance on the floor in the round, baby
 
   [Pre Chorus]
Bb                    Dm
People always told me be careful what you do
Bb                                    Dm
don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Bb                             Dm
She came and stood right by me then the smell of her sweet perfume
Bb                                         A
this happened much too soon  She called me to her room
A7sus4
(Hey Hey Hey)

Billie Jean is not my lover
D5                                         Gm
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
Gm                    Dm
But the kid is not my son
Dm                    D5     D
Billie Jean is not my lover
D5                                         Gm

D   D5   Dm   D5
 
D5                Gm                         Dm
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
D5                Gm                         Dm
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
