fél hanggal magasabban (G=G#)
| G | C9 | Bb | D C |
      G       C9
won't someone give me a gun?
Bb                   D   C
oh, well it's for my brother
     G                  C9
well he writes the line wrote down my spine
        Bb                    D    C                D    C
it says "oh do you believe in love there?"
   G    Bm       C    D     G      Bm        C   D
so slow down, so slow down, you're taking me over
    G     Bm     C      D      G    Bm        C    D Db
and so we drown, sir we drown, stop taking me over

      G       C9
won't someone give me some fun?
            Bb             D          C
(and as the skin flies all around us)
   G                     C9
we kiss in his room to a popular tune
Bb       D      C      D   C
oh, real drowners

   G    Bm       C    D     G      Bm        C   D
so slow down, so slow down, you're taking me over
    G     Bm     C      D      G    Bm        C    D Db
and so we drown, sir we drown, stop taking me over

(Solo here - could not figure out the transcription)

(End with repeating chorus)
