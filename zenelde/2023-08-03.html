[Verse 1]
F#          C#    D#m             B
I took her out, It was a friday night
F#        C#           D#m           B
I wore cologne,  to get the feeling right
F#           C#
We started making out
      D#m     B
 And she took off my pants
F#             C#        B
But then I turned on the TV
 
[Chorus 1]
N.C.
And that's about the time
     F#              C#
she walked away from me
D#m     B                       F#    C#
Nobody likes you when you're  twenty three
D#m       B                   F#   C#
 And I'm still more amused by TV show
D#m            B
 What the hell is A.D.D?
    F#            C#
My friends say I should act my age
D#m                  C#
 Whats my age again?   whats my age
   B
again?
 
[Verse 2]
F#         C#
But later on
    D#m       B
On the drive home
F#          C#    D#m     B
I called her mom from a pay phone
F#          C#
I said I was the cops
          D#m          B
And your husbands in jail
F#                C#     D#m    C#
The state looks down on sodomy
 
[Chorus 2]
    B
And that's about the time
          F#         C#
the bitch hung up on me
D#m      B
 Nobody likes you when you're
F#       C#
twenty three
D#m       B                    F#
 And I'm still more amused by prank
       C#
phone calls
D#m                B
 What the hell is call I.D.?
    F#                  C#
My friends say I should act my age
D#m                 C#
 Whats my age again? whats my age
 
[Instrumental]
D#m  C#  B  C#
D#m  C#  B  C#
D#m  C#  B  C#
D#m  C#  B  C#
again?
 
[Chorus 3]
     B
And that's about the time
    F#               C#
she walked away from me
D#m     B
Nobody likes you when you're
F#       C#
twenty three
D#m      B
And you still act like you're in
F#        C#
freshman year
D#m                B
What the hell is wrong with me?
    F#                  C#
My friends say I should act my age
D#m                    C#
Whats my age again? (whats my age again?)
 
[Chorus 4]
         F#                  C#
thats when she broke up with me
        D#m             B
No one should take themselves so
F#    C#
seriously
D#m        B              F#       C#
With many years ahead to fall in line
D#m                  B
Why would you wish down on me
F#             C#
I never want to act my age
D#m                  C#
 Whats my age again? whats my age again?
 
[Intrumental]
F#   C#   D#m   B
F#   C#   D#m   B
F#   C#   D#m   B
F#   C#   D#m
 
[Outro]
C#             B
Whats my age again?
