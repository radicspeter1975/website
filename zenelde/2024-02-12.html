      E
This friend of mine, he looks real good
                                   D    A
He drives a fast car and lives in Hollywood
      E
He treats me like his little sis
                              D          A E
I got to let him know I want more than this

His girlfriend Jane is a prissy brat
I don't know what he sees in that
Think, she's cool in her short tight dress
Take away the glamour and she's just a mess

       A E/G# F#m
Do you ever think of me
   C#m                A
As more than just a friend?
E/G#              D         B
Ever, will this dream never end?

Chorus:
       E         A         D
I got love eyes looking at you
I got a big heart made for two
Would you feel the same if you only knew
       E       D            E
I got Love eyes looking at you?

I want to close my eyes and take a deep breath
I want to be strong but I'm scared to death
I want to put your arms around my waist
And tell you that I love you right to your face

Do you ever think of me
As more than just a friend?
Ever, will this dream never end?

Chorus

This friend of mine, he looks real good
Guess who made it to Hollywood
No more Jane, I got her beat
Now I'm sitting pretty in the front seat
Have you ever looked at me
And felt the feeling of heaven
With the two of us in love?

Chorus - x2
