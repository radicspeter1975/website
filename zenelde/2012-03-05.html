Voice of Judas: 
       E                         G7 
       Everytime I look at you I don't understand 
       A7                                 E7 
       Why you let the things you did get so out of hand 
       You'd have managed better if you'd had it planned 
       Why'd you choose such a backward time and such a strange land? 
       If you'd come today you would have reached a whole nation 
       Israel in 4 B.C. had no mass communication 
 
Girls: Don't you get me wrong  (now)
Judas: Don't you get me wrong  
 
Girls: Only want to know (now)
Judas: Only want to know

         Who are you?  What have you sacrificed? 
         Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ
         Who are you?  What have you sacrificed? 

         Jesus Christ Superstar
         Do you think you're what they say you are?

Voice of Judas: 
       E                                 G7 
       Tell me what you think about your friends at the top  
       A7                                      E7 
       Who d'you think besides your self's the pick of the crop? 
       Buddha was he where it's at? Is he where you are? 
       Could Mohammed move a mountain or was that just PR? 
       Did you mean to die like that?  Was that a mistake or 
       Did you know your messy death would be a record-breaker?
