 (capo on third fret) D=F
Intro:  D       G  D       G  Asus4      A
 
 D   A               D          G              G A
 What is it that makes me just a little bit queasy
 D            A                  D      G         G A
 There's a breeze that makes my breathing not so easy
 F           Bb                     C
 I've had my lungs checked out with X-rays
 F   Bb       C      Dm        Bbsus2
 I've smelled the hospital hallways
 
 SHORT CHORUS:
  D       G         D                 A
 Someday I'll have    a disappearing hairline
 D       G         D   A             G      A
 Someday I'll wear    pajamas in the daytime
 D  A                D       G             G  A
 Times when the day seems like a play by Sartre
 D   A                D       G            G  A
 When it seems a book burnings in perfect order
 F          Bb          C
 I gave the doctor my description
 F    Bb     C            Dm      Bbsus2
 I've tried to stick to my prescription
  
 LONG CHORUS:
 D       G          D                 A
 Someday I'll have     a disappearing hairline
 D       G          D                 A
 Someday I'll wear     pajamas in the daytime
 G       D
 Oh, oh, oh, oh              (or something to that effect)
 A    D             G
 Afternoons will be measured out
 Bm               G
 Measured out and measured with
 A     D    G           G  A
 Coffeespoons and T.S. Eliot
  
 (The remaining verse and chorus repeat the same chord progression)
  
 Maybe if I could do a play-by-playback
 I could change the test results that I would get back
 I've watched a summer evening pass by
 I've heard the rattle in my bronchi
 
 REPEAT LONG CHORUS
