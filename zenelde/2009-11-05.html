C           Am
Hold on to love
             Em
That is what I do
               G
Now that I've found you
C          Am
And from above
            Em
Everything's stinking
            G
They're not around you
    C
And in the night
          Am
I could be helpless
           Em                     G
I could be lonely, sleeping without you
    C                       Am
And in the day, everything's complex
                Em                  G
There's nothing simple when I'm not around you

      C                    Am
But I miss you when you're gone
        Em        F
That is what I do

Hey baby
C                  Am
It's hard to carry on
             Em     F
That is what I knew

Hey baby...

C          Am
Hold on to my hands
          Em
I feel I'm sinking
           G
Sinking without you
C         Am
And to my mind
            Em
Everything's stinking
           G
Stinking without you
    C                      Am
And in the night I could be helpless
          Em                  G
I could be lonely, sleeping without you
     C                      Am
And in the day, everything's complex
               Em
There's nothing simple
               G
When I'm not around you

       C                    Am
And I miss you when you're gone
             Em   F

That is what I do

Hey baby
C                  Am
And it's hard to carry on
             Em   F
That is what I do
