O.K. here's the song lyrics: (and also a guide to where the riffs go, in brakets)

(riff 1 x3)
(riff 1 repeated from here....)
Your dead but the world keeps spinning,
take a spin through the world you've lived,
it's getting dark a little to early,
are you missing the dearly ?? raft.

Take a flight and you could be here tommorow,
take a flight well you could get here tonight,
I,m gonna fly on down for the last stop in this town,
what, i'm gonna fly on down and fly away,
well alright.
(....to here)

(chords played x4)
hey ha ye ye hey ha ye ya,
ha ye ye hey ha ye ya,
taking a spin through the neighbourhood,
the neighbours scream what ya talking about,
'cause i don't know how to let you in,
and i can't let you out.

(other bits that i can't be bothered to tab)
What if i was not your only friend in this world,
can you take me where you're going,
if you're never coming back.

I,m gonna fly on down for the last stop in this town,
i'm gonna fly on down and fly away on my way,

(muted chord riff x6)
hey ha ye ye hey ha ye ya,
ha ye ye hey ha ye ya,
(riff 1 repeated to the chords)
ha ye ye hey ha ye ya,
ha ye ye hey ha ye ya,
When we take a ride away up high through the neighbourhood,
all built of the billboards and the factorys and smoke,
I,m gonna fly on down for the last stop in this town,
yeah, i'm gonna fly on down and fly away on my way.

fly away.

(chords played x2 and riff 1 x2)
hey ha ye ye hey ha ye ya,
ha ye ye hey ha ye ya,
