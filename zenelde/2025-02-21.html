(Tiffany 5 félhanggal magasabban A=D)

intro: A E D A

A          C#m   F#m              E
Children behave, that's what they say when were together
A                 C#m   F#m        E
And watch how you play, they don't understand, and so were
 
Chorus 1:
 
C#m                        A    C#m                         A
Running just as fast as we can, holding on to one another's hand
G                                            E                                     
Trying to get away into the night & then you put your arms around me & we tumble to
                       A
 the ground & then you say
A              E               D                     A
I think we're alone now, there doesn't seem to be anyone around
A              E             D                            A
I think we're alone now, the beating of our hearts is the only sound
 
 
Verse 2:
 
A           C#m  F#m      E
Look at the way, we gotta hide what were doing
A                     C#m  F#m          E
Cause what would they say, if they ever knew, and so we're
 
Chorus 2:
 
C#m                        A    C#m                         A
Running just as fast as we can, holding on to one another's hand
G                                            E                                     
Trying to get away into the night & then you put your arms around me & we tumble to
                       A
 the ground & then you say
A              E               D                     A
I think we're alone now, there doesn't seem to be anyone around
A              E             D                            A
I think we're alone now, the beating of our hearts is the only sound
 
 
Chorus 3/Outro:
 
A              E               D                     A
I think we're alone now, there doesn't seem to be anyone around
A              E             D                            A
I think we're alone now, the beating of our hearts is the only sound
A              E               D                     A
I think we're alone now, there doesn't seem to be anyone around
A              E             D                            A
I think we're alone now, the beating of our hearts is the only sound
