Verse 1:
 
     A
It's just gone noon,
     Gm
Half past monsoon,
       A
On the banks of,
          Gm
The river Nile.
     A
Here comes the boat,
     Gm
Only half-afloat,
        A
Oarsman grins a,
          Gm
Toothless smile.
 
     A
Only just one more,
        Gm
To this desolate shore,
     A
Last boat along,
          Gm
The river Nile.
        A
Doesn't seem to care,
        Gm
No more wind in his hair,
      A
As he reaches his,
          Gm
Last half mile.
 
        Dm
The oar snaps in his hand,
          Fm
Before he reaches dry land,
        Dm
But the sound doesn't,
           Bb7
Deafen his smile.
     Dm
Just pokes at wet sand,
        Fm
With an oar in his hand,
       Dm                 C
Floats off down the River Nile,
                    B     A7    Bb  B  C
Floats off down the River Nile.
