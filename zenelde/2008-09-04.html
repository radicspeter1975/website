She goes
places I won't go
She knows
things that I don't know

Welcome to the Church of Noise
Welcome to the Church of Noise

<i>It takes more than intellect to be a musician,
put your soul in to it little, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.steynonline.com/10699/carnival-of-souls">okey</a>?</i>

This goes
Way beyond beliefs
Take this
Far away from me

Welcome to the Church of Noise
Welcome to the Church of Noise

Empire's singing on the backdoor step
Showband's dyin' on my radio set
Every light shines out on a Sunday
Heaven sent with quilt and regret
I am lost in your acetylene light, so bad
One more trip. One more trip to my head
To my head now

Red skies
Summer marches on
We should go away together
Mongrels in a mess forever

Welcome to the Church of Noise
Welcome and welcome
Welcome to the Church of Noise
