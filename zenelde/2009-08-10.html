[Intro]
Em D
 
        C                 B                        C                        B
Grandfather watches the grandfather clock and the phone hasn?t rang for so long
         C                     B                   C                     B
And the time flies by like a vulture in the sky, suddenly he breaks into song.
      G             Am      Bm                  C             G              Am     B   C
I'm  waiting by the phone, waiting for you to call me up and tell me I?m not alone
    G            Am    Bm                 C              G                Am        BM  C
Waiting by the phone, waiting for you to call me up and tell me I?m not alone.
  C                          B                     C                      B
Hello, speak up, is there somebody there?  These hang-ups are getting me down
       C                       B            C                           B
In a world frozen over with overexposure, let's talk it over, let's go out and paint the town.
     G             Am        Bm              C              G               Am      Bm    C
I'm waiting by the phone, waiting for you to call me up and tell me I?m not alone.
      C      B    Am          C       B      Am         C       B      Am
Cause I... want somebody to shove, I need somebody to shove, I want somebody
     C
to shove me.

Em D
 
           C                     B                         C
You're a dream for insomniacs, prize in the CrackerJacks, all the difference in the world
     B
is just a call away.
         G              Am      Bm               C              G                 Am   Bm   C
And I'm waiting by the phone, waiting for you to call me up and tell me I?m not alone.
      G                 Am          Bm                C
Yes, I'm waiting by the phone, I'm waiting for you to call me,
     G            Am           Bm               C
Come call me and tell me I'm, tell me I?m not alone
       C     B      Am         C         B     Am         C       B      Am
Cause I... want somebody to shove,  I need somebody to shove, I want somebody
     C
to shove me
    C      B      Am         C       B      Am         C       B      Am
Yes I... want somebody to shove, I need somebody to shove, I want somebody to...
    C
