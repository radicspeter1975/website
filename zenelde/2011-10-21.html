G D C D x2

G                    D                     C
   I'm coming,  I'm coming home to you
G           D           C
   I'm alive I'm a mess
G          D                 C
   I can't wait to get home to you
           G          D                     C
To get warm, warm and undressed

There've been changes beyond my dreams
Everybody wants me to sing
There've been changes beyond my grasp
Things I'm sinking in

     G                 D                C    D
So keep me (keep me)
             G   D C       D       G
In your bed,  all day,  all day
               D                      C          D
Nothing heals me like you do
G              D                       C           D
  Nothing heals me like you do

And when somebody knows you well
Well, there's no comfort like that
And when somebody needs you
Well, there's no drug like that

So keep me (keep me)
In your bed  all day,  all day
Nothing heals me like you do
Keep me (keep me)
In your bed, all day,  all day
Nothing heals me like you do
Nothing heals me like you do

Em  A  C x2

G D C x2

And when I'm home, curled in your arms
And I'm safe again
I'll close my eyes and sleep, sleep
To the sound of London Rain

So keep me (keep me)
In your bed, all day,  all day
Nothing heals me like you do
So keep me (keep me)
In your bed  all day,  all day
Nothing heals me like you do
Nothing heals me like you do

G               D            C               D
   Nothing falls like   London Rain
G               D                      C           D
   Nothing heals me like you do
G               D            C               D
   Nothing falls like   London Rain
G               D                      C           D
   Nothing heals me like you do
G               D            C               D
   Nothing falls like   London Rain
G              D                        C           D     G
   Nothing heals me like you do
