[Intro]
B    G#m  F#  x3
 
[Verse]
 B
I've waited hours for this
 
I've made myself so sick
   G#m
I wish I'd stayed
  F#
asleep today
 B
I never thought this day would end
                               G#m
I never thought tonight could ever be
      F#
this close to me
 
[Verse 2]
B
Just try to see in the dark
 
just try to make it work
   G#m                         F#
to feel the fear before you're here
  B
I make the shapes come much too close
 
I pull my eyes out
        G#m                     F#
hold my breath and wait until I shake...
 
[Bridge]
 E
But if I had your faith
                               B
then I could make it safe and clean
 E
If only I was sure
                               B
that my head on the door was a dream
 
[Instrumental]
(There's a part here with horns but the underliner is the B    G#m  F#  progression)
 
[Verse]
 B
I've waited hours for this
 
I've made myself so sick
  G#m              F#
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
B
I never thought this day would end
                              G#m
I never thought tonight could ever be
      F#
this close to me
 
[Bridge]
 E
But if I had your face
                              B
then I could make it safe and clean
 E                                                     B
if only I was sure that my head on the door was a dream
 
(Repeat  B    G#m  F#  progression until you want it to end, unless of course you have
a trumpet like the recording.)
