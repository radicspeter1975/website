fél hanggal mélyebben (G=F#)

A|---2-3-2-0-2-

G           D    Dsus4 D     G
And to love                a god
             D    Dsus4 D       Em
And to fear                 a flame
            Bm7
And to burn
    Cadd9
A crowd that has a name

And to right or wrong
And to meek or strong
It is known
Just scream it from a wall

Dsus2
I've willed, I've walked
I've read, I've talked
I know, I know
I've been here before

Chorus:
Em            A                                 Em:
Hey, hey, hey, now we won't be raped
          A                                  Em
Hey, hey, now we won't be scarred like that
          A                                Em
Hey, hey, now we won't be raped
          A                               Cadd9
Hey, hey, now we won't be scarred like that

G            D     Dsus4 D            G
It's the song                 that burns
               D    Dsus4 D          Em
It's the wheel                that turns
            Bm7
It's the way
    Cadd9
We sing that makes 'em dream

And to Christ, a cross
And to me, a chair
I will sit
And earn the ransom from up here

I've willed, I've walked
I've read, I've talked
I know, I know
]I've been here before

Chorus:
Em             A                                Em
Hey, hey, hey, now we won't be raped
          A                                 Em
Hey, hey, now we won't be scarred like that
          A                                 Em
Hey, hey, now we won't be raped
          A                               Csus2
Hey, hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Dsus2
Scarred like that

Solo:       Esus2-Dsus2-Csus2-G-D-G-D

And to love a god
And to fear a flame
And to burn
A crowd that has a name
