[Intro]

[Verse 1]
A                         D
Well Jo'anna she runs a country
              A                  E
She runs in Durban and the Transvaal
             A                  D    Dm
She makes a few of her people happy, oh
           A              E      A
She don't care about the rest at all
 
[Verse 2]
             A                   D
She's got a system they call apartheid
             A                E
It keeps a brother in a subjection
              A                D     Dm
But maybe pressure can make Jo'anna see
       A              E       A    E
How everybody could a live as one, oh
 
[Chorus]
A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
D
Hope, Jo'anna
        A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
             E
'Fore the morning come
       A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
D
Hope, Jo'anna
A                 E       A
Hope before the morning come
 
[Verse 3]
            A                    D
I hear she makes all the golden money
            A                     E
To buy new weapons, any shape of guns
             A                  D    Dm
While every mother in black Soweto fears
    A             E    A
The killing of another son
 
[Verse 4]
           A                        D
Sneakin' across all the neighbors' borders
          A                 E
Now and again having little fun
            A                    D         Dm
She doesn't care if the fun and games she play
    A           E    A    E
is dang'rous to ev'ryone, oh
 
[Chorus]
A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
D
Hope, Jo'anna
        A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
             E
'Fore the morning come
       A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
D
Hope, Jo'anna
A                 E       A
Hope before the morning come
 
[Verse 5]
              A                   D
She's got supporters in high up places
                A                 E
Who turn their heads to the city sun
         A                   D     Dm
Jo'anna give them the fancy money, oh
   A        E          A
to tempt anyone who'd come
 
[Verse 6]
           A                  D
She even knows how to swing opinion
          A                    E
In every magazine and the journals
           A                  D       Dm
For every bad move that this Jo'anna makes
            A        E  A    E
They got a good explanation, oh
 
[Chorus]
A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
D
Hope, Jo'anna
        A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
             E
'Fore the morning come
       A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
D
Hope, Jo'anna
A                 E       A
Hope before the morning come
 
[Verse 7]
           A                    D
Even the preacher who works for Jesus
        A                       E
The Archbishop who's a peaceful man
         A                    D        Dm
Together say that the freedom fighters will
A            E       A
overcome the very strong
 
[Verse 8]
           A                     D
I want to know if you're blind Jo'anna
       A                          E
If you want to hear the sound of drums
          A                    D        Dm
Can't you see that the tide is turning, oh
              A              E       A    E
don't make me wait till the morning come, oh
 
[Outro]
A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
D
Hope, Jo'anna
        A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
             E
'Fore the morning come
       A
Gimme hope, Jo'anna
D
Hope, Jo'anna
A                 E       A
Hope before the morning come
