G C
Danny is lonely cos mary's in india now
G C
she said she'd call but that was three weeks ago
G C
she left all her things well, her books and her letters from him
G D C
and as the sun rises on mary, it sets on him
Chorus:
G D C
just dance, just drink and just see the things
D G
I'll probably never get a chance to see
Verse:
G C
Danny's not eating, he's drinking and sleeping in
G C
I saw him last night at a party, he's definitely thin
G C
he says he's happy, he looked pretty good but I think
G D C
that as the sun rises on mary, it sets on him
Chorus:
G D C
And just dance, and just drink and just see the things
D G
I'll probably never get a chance to see
Verse:
G C
Danny came over last night and I cooked for him
G C
we talked about you mary and how much we loved you still
G C
he told me he's packed up your books and your letters and things
G D C
and as the sun sets on mary, it's rising on him
Chorus:
G D C
And we danced and we drank and I've seen some things
D G
you probably never got a chance to see
G D C
don't worry mary, cos I'm taking care of danny
D G
and he's taking care of me
