             G            Bb             
They call me white devil, Black Jesus,  
A              F 
Heaven closes, Hell freezes,

Scripts keep flippin'

Ballers ballin' 
Bb 
Players playin', 
A 
Haters fightin', 
F 
Righteous prayin' 
G 
Dawn breaking, 
   Bb 
Manhattan keeps making, 
A 
Brooklyn keeps takin' 
F 
Shook ones keep shakin', 
G 
No time for fakin' 
Bb                     A 
Know what I mean ain't choppin' no pies, 
     F 
Just risin' like cream 
G 
If you're digging the scene, 
Bb 
If you feelin' the vibes, 
A 
Throw your hands in the air, 
F 
Scream out you're alive,

G               Bb 
B.Boy poses and punk rock chicks, 
A                            F

If you're livin' like thugs, 
       G                     Bb 
I spit kisses and hugs like .45 slugs 
     A                           F 
Come back on the one and kiss my love gun 
G 
Gotta look that will kill, 
Bb 
A voice that will carry, 
A                          F 
Half a dozen women I think I wanna marry, 
G                   Bb    
Trouble on my mind, refusin' to lose 
A                     F 
Still I've gotta find someone to abuse 
G 
So won't you run spread the news 
Bb 
Help say the word 
(no guitar, just count the beats) 
And jump the fuck back and act like you heard 

CHORUS 
             G            Bb           A 
They call me white devil, Black Jesus, heaven closes 
F             G            Bb           A 
Hell freezes, Black Jesus, White Moses, heaven freezes 
F                    G        Bb               
Hell closes, singin' na na nana na na  
        A        F 
singin' na na nana na na 

\*That’s the basic idea, the rest is pretty much the same\* 

They call me white sinner, 
Black martyr, 
Live wire 
Fire starter, 
Jungle brother, 
Red neck cracker, 
Freak of nature 
New world slacker, 
Sex junkie lookin' for a dealer 
You can play the leaper girl and I can play the healer 
Shit is only getting realer baby haven't you heard that the 
Bird, bird, bird, yes the bird is the word 

They go one for the trouble, 
Two for the time, 
Three for my homies 
And four for the dimes, 
Singin' lemons to the lime 
Till the break of dawn 
Excuse me (every six minutes) 
Everlast you're on, 
And they go on and on 
Like a rolling stone, 
Baby anywhere I lay my hat is my home 

CHORUS 

They call me white devil, Black Jesus, 
Heaven closes, Hell freezes, 
Black Jesus, White Moses, 
Heaven freezes, Hell closes, 
Singin' na na nana na na singing 
(Repeat)
