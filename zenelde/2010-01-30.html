I need some sleep
You can't go home like this
I try counting sheep
But there's one I always miss

Everyone says I'm getting down to low
Everyone says, "You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go

I need some sleep time to put the old horse down
I'm in too deep and the wheels keep spinning round

Everyone says I'm getting down to low
Everyone says, "You just gotta let it go"
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go

You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
