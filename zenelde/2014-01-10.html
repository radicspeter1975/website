There's a place where a kid without a cent
He can grow up to be president.
A magic kingdom filled with barbie dolls
If you've got the time we can make it a good time.

Americanos - blue jeans and chinos

Coke Pepsi and oreos - americanos.
Movies and heroes in the land of the free
You can be what you wanna be.

They know how to advertise
Sell you anything at any price
Need it or not
That's what you got
Yeah.
Take no bull from anyone
We just wanna have some fun

We got the queen of soul
Created to rock'n roll
Yeah!

Americanos - blue jeans and chinos
Coke Pepsi and oreos - americanos.
Low riding chicanos in the land of the free
You can be what you wanna be.

Satellite stations across the nation
That's cable tv for you and me.
I' cleaning kitchens
Washing pots and pans

Everything's organized from crime to leisure time.
High schools and swimming pools
King sharks and fools.

Americanos - blue jeans and chinos
