Fél hanggal mélyebben (E=D#)

 E                  F#
Green light, Seven Eleven
     A                      E
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes
                 F#
You don't smoke, don't even want to
   A                    E
Hey now, check your change
           F#
Dressed up like a car crash
      A                           E
The wheels are turning but you're upside down

( Edge plays arpeggiated chords)
 F#m                                  E
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
 F#m                                  E
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive
 F#    A              E
Is that what it is?

(Edge plays main riff)
Red lights, grey morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who's around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip synch to the talk shows

(Edge plays arpeggiated chords)
 F#m                              C#m
And if you look, you look through me
                A
And when you talk it's not to me
                 B
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing

         F#m                                  E
If I could stay... then the night would give you up
  F#m                               E
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
  F#m            A                  E
Stay, and the night would be enough

(Edge plays main riff)
Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satellite television
You can go anywhere
Miami, New Orleans, London, Belfast and Berlin

(Edge plays arpeggiated chords)
And if you listen I can't call
And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout I'll only hear you

         F#m                                  E
If I could stay... then the night would give you up
  F#m                               E
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
  F#m           C#m
Stay with the demons you drowned
 A              B
Stay with the spirit I found
 F#m            A            E
Stay and the night would be enough

(Bono stops, Edge plays main riff)
Three o'clock in the morning
It's quiet and there's no one around
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel runs to ground
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel hits the ground
