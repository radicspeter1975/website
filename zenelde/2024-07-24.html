intro: F C gm C(7)

[Verse]
F
What's the deal with my brain?
C
Why am I so obviously insane?
Gm
In a perfect situation
C(7)
I let love down the drain.
F
There's the pitch, slow and straight.
C
All I have to do is swing
          Gm             C
and I'm a hero, but I'm a zero.
 
F
Hungry nights, once again
C
Now it's getting unbelievable.
Gm
'Cause I could not have it better,
C
But I just can't get no play
F
From the girls, all around
C
As they search the night for someone to hold onto.
         Gm      C
And I just pass through...
 
[Chorus]
singing...
F            C            Gm         C
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.
 
Singing..
F            C            Gm          C
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.
 
[Verse]
F
Get your hands off the girl,
C
Can't you see that she belongs to me?
Gm                         C
And I don't appreciate this excess company.
F                              C
Though I can't satisfy all the needs she has
                      Gm
And so she starts to wander...
C
Can you blame her?
 
[Chorus]
singing...
F            C            Gm         C
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.
 
Singing..
F            C            Gm          C
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.
 
[Bridge]
Dm
Tell me there's a logic out there.
C
Leading me to better prepare
Bb                                     C
For the day that something really special might come.
Dm
Tell me there's some hope for me.
C
I don't wanna be lonely
Bb                         C
For the rest of my days on the earth.
 
[Chorus]
singing...
F            C            Gm         C
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.
 
Singing..
F            C            Gm          C
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh.
