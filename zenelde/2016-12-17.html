[Other verses]

   Seether is neither big nor small
   Seether is the center of it all

   I try to knock her out
   I try to cram her back in my mouth (yeah)

   Keep her down, boiling water
   F#                           C#
   Keep her down, what a lovely daugther
          D#
   Oh she is not born like other girls
C#
   But I know how to conceive her
          D#
   Oh she may not look like other girls
F#
   But she's a snarl-toothed Seether (Seether!)
