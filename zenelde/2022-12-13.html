           D  A  Em      A       D     A
Everybody here ... comes from somewhere
Em       G                   D         A    Em   A   D   A  Em   G
... That they would just as soon forget and disguise

        D        A           Em      A
At the summer camp where you volunteered
        D        A           Em      G
No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
        D        A           Em      A
If that apparition, it just appeared
        D        A           Em      G
Took you up and away from this space
        D        A           Em      A         D     A    Em    G
In sheer humiliation, of your teenage station

D       A          Em          A
Nobody cares, no one remembers
D       A          Em          G
And nobody cares

Em        G     D        A
And you cried and you cried
Em        G     D        A
He's alive, he's alive
Em        G     D        A
And you cried and you cried and you cried and you cried

D  A  Em   A
D  A  Em   G

        D        A           Em      A
If you call out safe, then I'll stop right away
        D        A           Em      G
If the premise buckles, and the rope starts to shake
        D        A           Em      A
For the detail's marked, but the story's the same
        D        A           Em      G
You don't have to explain, you don't have to explain
        D        A           Em      A         D     A    Em    G
Humiliation ... of your teenage station

Em        G     D        A
Yeah you cried and you cried
Em        G     D        A
He's alive, he's alive
Em        G     D        A
Ah you cried and you cried and you cried

         Fmaj7         Em
And you realize your fantasies
         Fmaj7         Em
Are dressed up in travesties
Fmaj7  Em  C     B   C    A
Enjoy yourself with no regrets,  uh uh

D   A   Em   A
D   A   Em   G

           D  A  Em      A       D     A
Everybody here ... comes from somewhere
Em       G                   D         A   Em   A   D   A  Em   G
... That they would just as soon forget ... a disguise

Em        G     D        A
And you cried and you cried
Em        G     D        A
He's alive, he's alive
Em        G     D        A
Yeah you cried and you cried and you cried and you cried

        D        A           Em      A
Ah, you cried and you cried
        D        A           Em      G
Ah, you cried and you cried

        D        A           Em      A
Now, there's nothing dark and there's nothing weird
        D        A           Em      G
Don't be afraid, I will hold you near
        D        A           Em      A
From the seance where you first betrayed
        D        A           Em      G
An open heart on a darkened stage:
        D        A           Em      A         D     A    Em    G
A celebration of your teenage station

        D        A           Em      A
Zen experience, sweet delirious
        D        A           Em      G
Supernatural superserious
        D        A           Em      A
Inexperienced, sweet delirious
        D        A           Em      G
Supernatural superserious
