[Verse 1]
C                         Dm
  So you face it with a smile
                     F
There is no need to cry
                             C
For a trifle's more than this
 
C                           Dm
  Will you still recall my name
                       F
And the month it all began
                               C
Will you release me with a kiss
 
C                           Dm
  Have I tried to draw the veil
                          F
If I have - how could I fail?
                     C
Did I fear the consequence
 
[Breakdown]
C                   Dm
  dazed by careless words
           Ab Bb C
Cosy in my mind
 
[Chorus]
C         Dm
  I don't mind
        F
I think so
       C
I will let you go
 
...
 
[Verse 2]
C                               Dm
  Now you shaped that liquid wax
                        F
Fit it out with crater cracks
                           C
Sweet devotion - my delight
 
C                           Dm
  Oh, you're such a pretty one
                         F
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
                            C
Would tease me through the night
 
C                          Dm
  Now I hate to leave you bare
                        F
If you need me I'll be there
                      C
Don't you ever let me down
 
[Breakdown]
C                    Dm
  dazed by careless words
           Ab Bb C
Cosy in my mind
 
[Chorus]
C         Dm
  I don't mind
        F
I think so
       C
I will let you go
...
 
[Verse 3]
                   Dm
And I touched your face
                   F           C
Narcotic mind from lazed, Mary-Jane
                  Dm
And I called your name
                    F                                       C
Like an addicted to cocaine calls for the stuff he'd rather blame
 
                   Dm
And I touched your face
                   F              C
Narcotic mind from lazed, Mary-Jane
                  Dm
And I called your name
           F
My cocain
 
[Chorus]
C         Dm
  I don't mind
        F
I think so
       C
I will let you go
