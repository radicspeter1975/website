D Dsus 4 D Dsus2 D        D Dsus4 D x2

                    G                            A
Are you ready for me to be stronger 
                             G
I'm keeping my distance
                        A
My voice to a whisper
              G                               A
Are you ready for me to surrender
               Em
Cause I find in my return
                    G
There's no need to hide these words

              D                                      F#m
Cause maybe, maybe, I'm no angel, I'm no angel
         Bm          A           Gmaj7~G Gmaj7~G Gmaj7~G Gmaj7~G
But I feel, like I could fly
         D                                             F#m
And maybe, maybe, there's no rainbow, there's no rainbow
              Bm        A            G/B
But my love for you still shines

And I want to, I wanna be endless
I wanna be helpless
I want to be true
Like a sunbeam, 
The shadow's behind me, 
Sliding out of view
Let me bring it home to you

Cause maybe, maybe, I'm no angel, I'm no angel
But I feel, like I could fly
And maybe, maybe, there's no rainbow, there's no rainbow
But my love for you still shines

Em                           Bm
  Cause here I am,   here I am
G                                 A
   I've been running, long enough to know
Bm               D
   Here I am,  here I stand
G                                       A
   All this rung's got me longing in my soul
G A
    Longing in my soul

Cause maybe, maybe, I'm no angel, I'm no angel
But I feel, like I could fly
And maybe, maybe, there's no rainbow, there's no rainbow
But my love for you still shines
          D                                   F#m
Yeah maybe, maybe, I'm no angel, I'm no angel
         Bm          A        Gmaj7~G Gmaj7~G Gmaj7~G Gmaj7~G
But I feel, like I could fly 
       D                                        F#m
And maybe, maybe, there's no rainbow, there's no rainbow
             Bm        A          G/B                        D
But my love for you still shines, my love still shines
