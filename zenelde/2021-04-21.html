1:
    E         
From London to Lisbon
    am  
And all points between

Find people to lean on
And one man to please

2:
    c#m
We all need someone
    F#
We all need something
    E        am     
We all need'..

1: I'm lustless, lifeless
The scent of my skin
It means nothing without you
That's where it begins

2: We all need someone
We all need something

We all need'.. we all need'

    E
Get out for your sakes
    B    A
Do you want it?
    f#m     B   A 
No promises are spoken
E                            am
Take it or leave it, do you like it?
    c#m        B        A    am
And no man's heart gets broken

1:One day to another
I'm head over heels
One room to another
It sets the same scene

2:We all need someone
We all need something
We all need'.. we all need'

f#m    B      E   
Every man for himself
           A
Just for a little while

f#m    B      E
Every man for himself
           A
Just for a short while
f#m            g#m 
You could came around
              A            
We could fool around and get down
                    B                     
It's the way it could be
              
And a way it's always been

1:Oh, from London to Lisbon
I'm head over heels
Take it or leave it
Just come as you please

We all need
Someone, somewhere, somehow
