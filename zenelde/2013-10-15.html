F       dm            Bb
 Cannot make it here, I'm over it
 I've been feelin weird, get over it
C                     Bb 
 Cannot wind up free, I'm over it
 C                    Bb            C
 Is there more to see? I'm over it
 
F                G
 What else should I do
Bb               C 
 If I run around for you?
 What am I supposed to do?
 Keep it comin', ohh they do
