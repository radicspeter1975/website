<pre>
Bb 
Shine the headlight, straight into my eyes. 
Like the roadkill, I'm paralysed. 
         Eb
You see through my disguise 

Bb 
At the drive-in, double feature, 
pull the lever, break the fever 
       Eb 
and say your last goodbyes. 
       
        Gm               F         Bb 
Since I was born I started to decay. 
        Gm               F         Bb 
Now nothing ever ever goes my way
