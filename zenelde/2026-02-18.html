[Intro]
Dm - Am - Dm - C

Dm
A vacation in the foreign land

Uncle Sam does the best he can
		   Gm
You're in the army now
				  Dm
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

Dm
Now you remember what the draft man said

Nothing to do all day but stay in bed
		   Gm
You're in the army now
				 Dm
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

Dm
You'll be a hero of the neighbourhood

Nobody knows that you left for good
		   Gm
You're in the army now
Am                   Dm
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

Smiling faces on the way to 'Nam

But once you get there no one gives a damn
		   Gm
You're in the army now
Am                   Dm
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

Hand grenades flying over your head (drum breaks)

The sun's flying over your head

If you wanna survive get out of bed
		   Am
You're in the army now
Bm                   Em

The sergeant calls : "Stand up and fight!"

You're in the army now

Oh, oh you're in the army - now
		   Am
You're in the army now

You've got your orders to shoot on sight

Your finger's on the trigger but it don't seem right

You're in the army now

Oh, oh you're in the army - now
		   Am
You're in the army now
Bm                  Em
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

Em
Night is falling and you just can't see

Is this illusion or reality
		   Am
You're in the army now
Bm                  Em
Oh, oh you're in the army, in the army – now
		   Am
You're in the army now
Bm                  Em
Oh, oh you're in the army – now
		   Am
You're in the army now
Bm                  Em
Oh, oh you're in the army, in the army – now
		   Am
You're in the army now

 Oh, oh you're in the army – now
