    C#m
On candystripe legs spiderman comes,
 A
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun.
  C#m
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead,
 A
Looking for the victim shivering in bed.
 C#m
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom,
     A
And suddenly! A movement in the corner of the room!
              C#m
And there is nothing I can do when I realise with fright
           A
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight!

Intro:           C#m                           A

 C#m
Quietly he laughs, and shaking his head
         A
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed,
     C#m
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies,
     A
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes...
     C#m
"Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy,
         A
Don't struggle like that, or I will only love you more,
         C#m
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light;
      A
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight!"

      F#m
And I feel like I'm being eaten
                                     A
By a thousand million shivering furry holes,
      F#m
And I know that in the morning
                                  A
I will wake up in the shivering cold...
                                 C#m(\*)
And the spiderman is always hungry...

(\*) Begin to play the Intro tabs and chords.
