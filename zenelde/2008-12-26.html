intro: F  Fsus4  Bb  Bsus4
              
               F
Well we were born within an hour of each other

Our mothers said we could be sister and brother
                Bb
Your name is deborah.  Deborah, it never suited you
          F
And they said that when we grew up 

We'd get married and never split up
           Bb
We never did, although i often thought of it

                     Cm
Oh deborah, do you recall?

Your house was very small

With woodchips on the wall
                          Cm2
And when i came round to call
                                 F
You didnt notice me at all . . . . 

              Bb                
And i said, lets all meet up in the year 2000
Dm                                        Gm
won't it be strange when we're all fully grown
                            Cm               F
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
Bb
I never knew that you'd get married 
Dm                                 Gm
I would be living down here on my own   
                          Cm            F
On that damp and lonely thursday years ago

(chords as verse1)

you were the first girl in school to get breasts
Martin said that you were the best
the boys all loved you, but i was a mess
i had to watch them try to get you undressed
We were freinds that was as far as it went
I used to walk you home sometimes but it meant
Oh it meant nothing to you
cos you were, oh so popular

BRIDGE, CHORUS (x2)
