Egy hanggal magasabban (D=E)
[Intro]
D Bm Em A (2x)
 
[Verse]
                            D
You used to get it in your fishnets
                             Bm
Now you only get it in your night dress
                                    Em
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
                        A
Landed in a very common crisis
                            D
Everything's in order in a black hole
                               Bm
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
               (A)              Em
The Bloody Mary's lacking her Tabasco
                               A
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
 
[Chorus]
               Em
Oh the boy's a slag
                     A
The best you ever had
                     Em
The best you ever had
          A                Em
Is just a memory and those dreams
               A
But as daft as they seem
               Em
As daft as they seem
                  G
My love when you dream them up...
 
[Verse]
                                   D
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
                                  Bm
Remember when the boys were all electric?
        (A)                     Em
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
                                     A
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
                             D
Clinging to not getting sentimental
                              Bm
Said she wasn't going but she went still
           (A)                 Em
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
                                   A
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?
 
[Chorus]
               Em
Oh the boy's a slag
                     A
The best you ever had
                     Em
The best you ever had
          A                Em
Is just a memory and those dreams
               A
But as daft as they seem
               Em
As daft as they seem
                  G
My love when you dream them up
 
F#m               Bm
Oh, where did you go?
              Em
Where did you go?
              F#m  Em
Where did you go? Woah.
 
[Instrumental]
D Bm Em A
 
[Bridge/Outro]
D          Bm         (A)
Falling about
           Em              A
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
              D             Bm         (A)
You were just sounding it out
           Em             A
You're not coming back again.
 
D          Bm        (A)
Falling about
           Em              A
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
              D             Bm          (A)
You were just sounding it out
           Em             A
You're not coming back again.
 
                           D
You used to get it in your fishnets
                            Bm
Now you only get it in your night dress
                   (A)               Em
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
                        A
Landed in a very common crisis
                           D
Everything's in order in a black hole
                               Bm
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
                  (A)         Em
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
                              A
Remember when he used to be a rascal?
 
End on Bm
