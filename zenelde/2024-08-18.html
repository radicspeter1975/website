Intro
E, A, E, A (as chorus)
A, E, Dsus2 (as verse)
 
Verse I
A                E          Dsus2
I'm seemin' to be glad   a lot
A                E          Dsus2
I'm happy again, come, come in time
A                E          Dsus2
This mustn't hurt or harm yourself, well
A         E       Bm         Dsus2
Me, I give in    to your     arms
 
Chorus I
E                     A
You're the match of Jericho
            E             A
That will burn this old madhouse down
      E                      A
And I'll throw open like a walnut safe
              E                                 A
More like a love that's a bottle of exquisite stuff, yes
 
Verse II
A                E          Dsus2
You, yourself, and your   father
A                E          Dsus2
Don't know you're so apart in your own ways
A                E          Dsus2
You're really   both bone   setters
A         E      Bm         Dsus2
Thank you for mending me   babies
 
Chorus II
E                     A
You're the match of Jericho
            E             A
That will burn this old madhouse down
      E                      A
And I'll throw open like a walnut safe
              E
You will seem more than being throughout
      A               E
That same bottle of exquisite stuff
A                 E
Yes, you are that match of Jericho
          A             E
That will burn this old madhouse down
    A                       E
And I'll throw open like the walnut safe

You, yourself, and your father

Don't know him, so apart in your own ways
       E                A
You're really both bone setters
E                       A
Thank you for mending me babies
