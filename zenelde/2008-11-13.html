VERSE
             B           E           C#m  F#
You're all I have in this teenage twilight
             B       E          C#m  F#
Your golden hair and pale blue eyes
                    B            E         C#m    F#
But through all the days and the sleepless nights
        Em                    F#
We have never been satisfied

B          E        C#m    F#
Turn golden like the leaves
            B          E      C#m   F#
Yeah we are spirallin' on the breeze
              B        E    C#m  F#
Almost to the point of no return
                Em
Everything will burn baby burn

CHORUS
F#m                   B
Look into my twilit eyes
      E                      A
See a sign you wouldn't recognize
F#m                  B
Glad you can't be untied
   E                A
Oh this is so suicide
F#m                      B
Feelings that I can't disguise
    E                  A
And never will be reconciled
       F#m                  B      Am
Oh and something inside has died

VERSE
Walk right through in a daze
Unresponsive eyes in a distant gaze
Like all the good times have gone away
And the memory leaves a bitter taste

Turn golden like the leaves
Yeah we are spirallin' on the breeze
Destructive love is all we had
Destructive love is all I am

CHORUS (as before)

BRIDGE
E              F#
Vicious bitter words
         E                 F#
Becoming more and more cruel
E                        F#
But you always take them back
C#m
And let me hate the world

VERSE
Turn golden like the leaves
Yeah we are spirallin' on the breeze
Almost to the point of no return
Everything will burn baby burn

CHORUS
Look into my twilit eyes
See a sign you wouldn't recognize
Glad you can't be untied
Oh this is so suicide

Feelings that I can't disguise
We're living in a compromise
Oh and something inside has died

big finish on Am
