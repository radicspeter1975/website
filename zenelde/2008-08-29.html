 (capo 1st fret) 

 VERSE: G / D / e / C

 I go to sleep, before the devil wakes 
 And I wake up, before the angels take 
 
 All my secrets untold 
 All my motives unclear 

 Hangin' down in the fire 
 Burnin' them higher 
 Won't take them away from here 

 CHORUS: G / D / Am / C

 And long after we're gone 
 The light will stay on 
 The light will stay on 

 Watched the city, . . . city of crows 
 Watched them fly, watched 'em all flyin' low 

 Out above the flood plain 
 Just above the dirt road 

 They were hungry as winter 
 Hungry as us 
 Not afraid to be flyin' 
 Not afraid to be lost 

 And long after we're gone 
 The light will stay on 
 The light will stay on 

 And if you bury me, add three feet to it 
 One for you sorrow, two for your sweat 
 Three for the strange things we never forget 

 And long after we're gone 
 The light will stay on 
 The light will stay on 

 And long after we're safe 
 The lights will not fade 
 The lights will not fade
