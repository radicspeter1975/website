( Capo 2nd Fret ) D=E

D    A7    D
G          D

 D        A7                    D
How can I think I'm standing strong
     G                       D
Yet feel the air beneath my feet
 Bm                A        G
How can happiness feel so wrong
 F#m            A        D       A
How can misery feel so sweet

How can you let me watch you sleep
Then break my dreams the way you do
How can I have got in so deep
Why did I fall in love with you

Chorus:

              D                           F#m
This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been
         Em7                A
Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen
             D                            F#m
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known,
       Em7           G
I was never crazy ... on my own
     D       Bm                G               Bb
And now I know that there's a link between the two....
 D               Bm            A              D
Being close to craziness, and being close to you

D   A7   D
G        D

How can you make me fall apart
Then break my fall with loving lies
It's so easy to break a heart
It's so easy to close your eyes

How can you treat me like a child
Yet like a child I yearn for you
How can anyone feel so wild
How can anyone feel so blue

Chorus
D   Bm        A              D
      .. and being close to you ( x 2 )
