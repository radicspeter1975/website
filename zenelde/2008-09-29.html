[Intro]
Dsus2  Dm  Cmaj7  C
 
[Verse]
Dsus2           Dm                Cmaj7  C
     For a long time I was in love
Dsus2            Dm             Cmaj7  C
     Not only in love, I was obsessed
Dsus2         Dm             Cmaj7                 C
     With a friendship that no one else could touch
Dsus2               Dm                       Cmaj7  C
     It didn't work out, I'm covered in shells
 
[Chorus]
C              C7             F
     And all I wanted was the simple things
       Bb                 Cmaj7  C
     A simple kind of life
C              C7            F
     And all I needed was a simple man
        Bb
     So I could be the wife
 
[Verse]
Dsus2          Dm                    Cmaj7  C
     I'm so ashamed, I've been so mean
Dsus2             Dm                    Cmaj7  C
     I don't know how it got to this point
Dsus2         Dm                          Cmaj7  C
     I always was the one with all the love
Dsus2           Dm                      Cmaj7  C
     You came along, I'm hunting you down
 
[Chorus]
C                C7         F
     Like a sick domestic abuser 
     Bb                 Cmaj7  C
     Looking for a fight
C              C7              F
     And all I wanted was the simple things
       Bb                 Cmaj7  C
     A simple kind of life
 
[Bridge]
   Dm      C#           C                  B
     If we met tomorrow for the very first time
     Dm                 C#                  C               B
     Would it start all over again? Would I try to make you mine?
 
[Verse]
Dsus2          Dm                 Cmaj7  C
     I always thought I'd be a mom
Dsus2            Dm               Cmaj7  C
     Sometimes I wish for a mistake
Dsus2            Dm                  Cmaj7             C
     The longer that I wait the more selfish that I get
Dsus2         Dm                      Cmaj7  C
     You seem like you'd be a good dad
 
[Chorus]
C                   C7                F
     Now all those simple things are simply too
            Bb              Cmaj7  C
     Complicated for my life
C                    C7            F
     How'd I get so faithful to my freedom?
       Bb                  Cmaj7  C
     A selfish kind of life
     C                C7             F
     When all I ever wanted was the simple things
       Bb                 Cmaj7  C
     A simple kind of life
