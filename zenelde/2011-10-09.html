                       G
I've got to get to you first
            F
Before they do 
                        G
It's just a question of time
                      F
Before they lay their hands on you
                           Cm
And make you just like the rest
                       G#    D#
I've got to get to you first
                        Gm     F Gm F
It's just a question of time

                        G
Well now you're only fifteen
             F
And you look good 
                       G
I'll take you under my wing
    F
Somebody should
                   Cm
They've persuasive ways
                             G#   D#
And you'll believe what they say
                        Cm
It's just a question of time
     G#
It's running out for you
   Cm
It won't be long 
  Gm
Until you'll do
 G#               Bb
Exactly what they want you to

[Gm F Gm F]

               G
I can see them now
         F
Hanging around
            G
To mess you up
   F
To strip you down
               Cm
And have their fun
               G#  D#
With my little one

                        Cm
It's just a question of time
     G#
It's running out for you
   Cm
It won't be long 
  Gm
Until you'll do
 G#               Bb
Exactly what they want you to
   Cm
It won't be long 
  Gm
Until you'll do
 G#               Bb
Exactly what they want you to

Sometimes I don't blame them
For wanting you
You look good
And they need something to do
Until I look at you
And then I condemn them
I know my kind
What goes on in our minds

                        Gm
It's just a question of time
             F
It should be better
                        Gm
It's just a question of time
             F
It should be better with you
It's just a question of time
