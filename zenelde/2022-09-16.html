[Verse]
 B             G             F#
Hangin' round downtown by myself
           B                        G           F#
and I had so much time to sit and think about myself
                    B
and then there she was
      G             F#
like double cherry pie
                B
yeah there she was
      G          F#
like disco super-fly
 
[Chorus]

N.C.           Bm    G     A

N.C.               Bm    G      A
Who's that loungin' in my chair?
N.C.               Bm        G             A
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
                       D   A
Mama this surely is a dream, yeah
Bm                G          D      A      Bm   G  F#
  Yeah mama this surely is a dream, dig it

Hanging round downtown by myself
             B                           G            F#
and I've had too much caffeine and I was thinkin bout myself
                    B
and then there she was
   G               F#
in platform double suede
               B
yeah there she was
     G          F#
like disco lemonade
