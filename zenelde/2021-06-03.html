Intro With guitar and bass carrys on through verse 1

She's a perfect 10, but she wears a 12
Baby keep a little 2 for me
She could be sweet 16, bustin' out of the seams
It's still love in the first degree

(In the 2nd verese the 2nd guitar joins in with ther bass and 1st guitar
 but plays the instead)

A
When he's at my gate, with a big fat 8
A                               E
You wanna see the smile on my face
A
And even at my door, with a 4 4 4
A                            E
There ain't no man can replace

(Then comes the chorus In which the bass and 1st guitar join guitar 2
 with chords!)

A                                        Bm
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
              D                     A
I love her body, especially the lines
                                       Bm
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
              E               A
Promise me this, take me tonight
(In verse three & four, the 1st guitar and bass come back in with 
the funky intro riff the 2nd guitar plays chords again!!)

A
If he's extra large well I'm in charge
E
I can work this thing on top
A
If he's XXL well what the hell
E
Every penny don't fit the slot

A
The anorexic chicks, the model 6
E
They don't hold no weight with me
A
Well 8 or 9, well that's just fine
E
But I like to hold something I can see

(Back to chorus, yep you guessed it all guitars play chords!)

A                                        Bm
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
              D                     A
I love her body, especially the lines
                                       Bm
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
              E               A
Promise me this, take me tonight

Final Verse played the same as 2, 3 & 4

A
I've bought a watch, to time your beauty
E
But I've had to fit a second hand
A
I've bought a calendar, and every month
E
Is taken up by lover man

Chorus

A                                        Bm
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
              D                     A
I love her body, especially the lines
                                       Bm
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
              E               A
Promise me this, take me tonight

Finally to end the song!!! Just strum the chords once in the verse!

A                                        Bm
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
              D                     A
I love her body, especially the lines
                                       Bm
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
              E               A
Promise me this, take me tonight
