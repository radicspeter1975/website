Look at this Photograph, everytime I do it makes me laugh,
                        G                                   D
How did our eyes get so red, and what the hell is on Joey's head?
D                        A                                      C
And this is where I grew up, I think the present owner fixed it up,
                             G                                          D
I never knew we ever went without,the second floor is high for sneakin' out.
D                            A                                            C
And this is where I went to school, most of the time had better things to do,
                                G                                    D
Criminal record says I broke in twice, I must have done half a dozen times.
D                     A                                    C
I wonder if it's too late, should I go back and try to graduate,
                                   G
Life's better now than it was back then, if I was them I wouldn't let me
C
in...
           G
Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!

D                                                   A
Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread
                  C
out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it
G
Good-bye, Good-bye.
D                                                      A
Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
                   C
that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
G
Good-Bye, Good-Bye.

D                   A                                   C
Remember the old arcade? Blew every dollar that we ever made.
                          G                                         D
The Cops hated us hangin' out, they say somebody went and burned it down.
                          A                                       C
We use to listen to the radio and sing along with every song we'd know.
                                     G
We said someday we'd find out how it feels to sing to more than just the
         D
steering wheel.
D                       A                                     C
Kim's the first girl I kissed. I was so nervous that I nearly missed.
                                 G
She's had a couple of kids since then. I haven't seen her since god knows
C
when.

Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!

I miss that time, I miss their faces
            G                  D
You can't erase, You can't replace it.
           A                C
I miss it now. I can't believe it.
            G                 D     
So hard to stay. To hard to leave it.
