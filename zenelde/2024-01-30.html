     C
I'd rather not go
     D
Where the people i know
   F    Eb              C
Have no hooks to hang from

Now she wears fake-fur
It's speakin' volumes for her
It's a freak-show for Mother Nature

(Aaaaa- I can see you)
C                     D            
If the star impales a world from its pew
          F     Eb           C
It don't subscribe to its point of view
(Aaaaa- I can see you)
Some time is lost imprinting my mind
And so i honestly can see you
