CAPO 1ST FRET  (C=C#)

INTRO(Spoken): C 

C                                 
I hold an image of the ashtray girl 
Em 
As the cigarette burns on my chest 
C 
I wrote a poem that described her world 
Em 
That put our friendship to the test 
Am 
And late at night while I was on all fours 
Em 
She used to watch me kiss the floor 
F 
What's wrong with this picture? 
C 
What's wrong with this picture?} 
 
VERSE1: 
C                     Em 
Farewell the ashtray girl 
                C 
Forbidden snowflake 
                       Em 
Beware this troubled world 
                      Am 
Watch out for earthquakes 
                 Em 
Goodbye to open sores 
               F 
To broken semaphore 
                 C 
You know we miss her 
                 F 
We miss her picture 
 
CHORUS: 
                  C 
Sometimes it's faded 
           F 
Disintegrated 
                    C 
The fear of growing old 

F                 C 
Sometimes it's faded 
          F 
Assassinated 
                    C 
The fear of growing old 
 
VERSE2: 
C                     Em 
Farewell the ashtray girl 
              C 
Angelic fruitcake 
                       Em 
Beware this troubled world 
                Am 
Control your intake 
                 Em 
Goodbye to open sores 
                    F 
Goodbye and furthermore 
                  C 
You know we miss her

The fear of growing old

Sometimes it's faded 
          F 
Assassinated 
                    C 
The fear of growing old 
 
BRIDGE: 
Em   Am 
Hang on 
           Em 
Though we try 
     Am 
It's gone 
Em   Am 
Hang on

Though we try 
     Am    F 
It's gone

Assassinated 
                    C 
The fear of growing old
