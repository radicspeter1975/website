Intro: C-Am-Dm-Em-F

Verse:

               C     Am                 Dm-Em-F
          You say  I only hear what I want to 
          C                  Am          Dm-Em-F
          And you say I talk so all the time-so 
           Dm                    C  
          And I thought what I felt was simple
           Dm                       C
          And I thought that I don't belong
           Dm           C
          And now that I am leavin’
           Dm             C                                  F
          Now I know that I did something wrong cause I missed you
           Fm            F-C-F-C          
          Yeah, I missed you 

  
Verse:
           C                     Am
          And you say I only hear what I want to
           Dm
          I don't listen hard
          Em                                           F
          I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running or to 

          Anyone, anywhere
           Dm                              Em                             
          I don't understand if you really care
          F
          I'm only hearing negative, no no no-bad
              Dm                C                  Dm 
          So I turned the radio on I turned the radio up 

                               C
          And this woman was singing my song
           Dm                                      C
          The lover's in love  and the other's run away
               Dm                              C
          The lover is crying cause the other won't stay

Refrain:
              Dm                          C                       Dm
          And some of us hover when we weep for the other who was dying
                   C
          Since the day they were born well
           Dm
          Well this is not that

Verse:       
          C                         Dm       C 

          I think that I'm throwing but I'm thrown 
               Dm
          And I thought I'd live forever but now I'm not so sure
                     F
          You try to tell me that I'm clever but that won't take me anyhow
           Dm       C        Dm-C
          Or anywhere with you 
              Dm                  C
          And you said that I was naïve 
              Dm                     C
          And I thought that I was strong

  

           Dm                   C  
          I thought "hey I can leave, I can leave"
           Dm                              C            F
          But now I know that I was wrong cause I missed you       
             Fm F     C-F-C
          Yeah I missed you 

                                   Dm
          You said "you caught me cause you want me And one day I'll let you 
                     F
          You try to give away a keeper or keep me cause you're know
             Dm                  Em    F
          you're  just too  scared to loose 
                                 C    Am 
          And you say  stay"  dm-em-F
          C    Am
          You say I only hear what I
  
          want to. Dm-Em-F
