[Intro]
Eb      Bb      Cm
 
[Verse 1]
Eb                         Bb
When you’re all over me, I drown
                   Cm
I had over fealing Blue,
                            Cm
but your shine it seems the sound
                             Eb
That’s the sound that I once knew
                    Bb
In the ocean of the blue
                  Cm
Mirror skies that knew,
                             Cm
When the sun had gone, as we find our flow,
        Cm
and the night is over
 
[Middle Play]
Eb      Bb      Cm      Ab      Eb
 
[Chorus 1]
                        Bb
You fade away, you fade away, you fade away
         Cm             Ab                Eb
You fade away, you fade away, the passing night
               Bbm              Cm
before the morning
                      Ab
My broken heart can’t mend

You fade away, you fade away, the passing night

Eb                         Bb
When you’re all over me, I drown
                   Cm
I had over beating blue,
                               Ab
but your shine it seems the sound
                               Eb
That’s the sound that I once knew
 
Bb      Cm      Ab      Ab/G
 
[Chorus 3]
                        Bb
You fade away, you fade away, you fade away
         Cm             Ab                 Eb
You fade away, you fade away, the passing night

You fade away, you fade away, the passing night
               Bb              Cm
before the morning
                      Ab
My broken heart can’t mend
