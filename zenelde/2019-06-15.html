[Verse]

A Asus4       A        |Em7                 |A Asus4
     Walking 'round the room  singing stormy weather,
   A    |Em7                 |A Asus4
at Fifty-Seven Mount Pleasant Street.
     A       |Em7                        |A Asus4
Well,it's the same room  but everything's different,
        A        |Em7               |A Asus4    |
you can fight the sleep  but not the dream.

[Bridge]

Dm             C     |Dm      C      |Dm            C           |F       |
  Things ain't cookin'  in my kitchen,  strange aff-liction wash over me.
Dm       C     |Dm              C     |
  Julius Caesar   and the Roman Empire,
Dm         C          |F       |G    |Em7    |A    |Em7    |A
  couldn't conquer the blue sk - y.

[Verse]

               |Em7                |A Asus4
Well, there's a small boat  made of china,
     A     Em7                    A Asus4
it’s going nowhere  on the mantle-piece.
      A    Em7                    A Asus4
Well, do I lie  like a loungeroom lizard,
   A    Em7                 |A Asus4
or do I sing  like a bird re-leased.

[Chorus]
