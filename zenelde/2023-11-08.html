[Verse 1]
            D
She’s got a cigarette
A
Between both teeth
    Bm
The way we met
    G
Not so unique
       D
On the internet
   A
We make up things
  Bm
A different story
      G
Every person we see
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D            A           Bm     G
I don't know when I fell
D           A            Bm     G      D
She doesn't know as well
 
[Chorus]
     A                 Bm
On a beautiful Sunday
      G                   D
We’re laying in sun rays
      A                  Bm          G             D
She's wearing my beat up jean jacket so damn well
    A           Bm
One swipe of a finger
    G                    D
She leaves and I linger
      A               Bm         G
She’s killing me with desire for someone else
          D               A        Bm          G
Oh, these girls that make me wanna die
          D               A        Bm          G
Oh, these girls that make me wanna die
 
 
[Verse 2]
            D
I'm writing poems and
        A
They're all online
        Bm
Under a different name
     G
Nothing like mine
           D
I tried to tell her once
     A
On a drunken night
       Bm
But it came out all fucked
    G
Like a bad pick up line
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D       A           Bm     G
I don't know when I fell
D           A       Bm     G     D
She doesn't know as well
 
[Chorus]
     A                Bm
On a beautiful Sunday
      G                   D
We’re laying in sun rays
      A                  Bm          G            D
She's wearing my beat up jean jacket so damn well
    A          Bm
One swipe of a finger
    G                   D
She leaves and I linger
      A               Bm         G
She’s killing me with desire for someone else
          D               A        Bm      G
Oh, these girls that make me wanna die
          D               A        Bm      G
Oh, these girls that make me wanna die
