         E                                          Abm 
She was born in November 1963 the day Aldous Huxley died
F#m
And her mama believed that every man could be free
         A
So her mama got high, high, high
  C
And her daddy marched on Birmingham singing mighty protest songs
Am
And he pictured all the places where he knew that she belonged
      F                              Bb                              B
But he failed and taught her young the only thing she's need to carry on

He taught her how to

E                   C#m              Abm       B  
Run baby run baby run baby run baby run
     A                                  C  
Past the arms of the familiar and their talk of better days
       A                                 C                      D      B
To the comfort of the strangers slipping out before they say so long
              E
Baby loves to run

E                                                          Abm   
She counts out all her money in the taxi on the way to meet her plane
   F#m                                                                        
Stares hopeful out the window at the workers fighting 
                 A       
Through the pouring rain 
        C  
And she's searching through the stations for an unfamiliar song
      Am   
And she's pictures all the places where she knows she still belongs
 F                                          Bb                       B
And she smiles the secret smile because she knows exactly how To carry on

E                  C#m               Abm      B  
So run baby run baby run baby run baby run
          A                            C     
From the old familiar faces and their old familiar ways
        A                                 C                      D 
To the comfort of the strangers slipping out before they say so long
               E      
Baby loves to run
