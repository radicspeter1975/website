INTRO: Cadd2, C

Verse 1:
Cadd2               C           Cadd2         C
Every time you raise your voice I see the greener grass
Cadd2             C           Cadd2          C
Every time you run for cover I see this pasture
Cadd2                C           Cadd2         C
Every time we're in a funk I picture a different choice
Cadd2             C             Cadd2        C
Anytime we're in a rut, this distant grandeur
 
F                                   Dm
my tendency to want to do away feels natural
F                                          G
my urgency to dream of softer places feels understandable but I know
 
CHORUS
C
The only way out is through
The faster we're in the better
                                G
The only way out is through ultimately
C
The only way out is through 
The only way we'll feel better
                                G     C
The only way out is through ultimately
 
Verse 2:
 
Every time that I'm confused I think there must be easier ways
Every time our horns are locked I'm towel throwing
Every time we're at a loss we've bolted from difficulty
Anytime we're in stalemate, a final bowing
 
my tendency to want to hide away feels easier
The immediacy of picturing another place, comforting to go but I know
 
CHORUS:
The only way out is through
The faster we're in the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll feel better
The only way out is through ultimately
 
BRIDGE:
F                          Dm
We could just walk away and hide our heads in the sand
F                                Dm                    F                   C
We could just call it quits only to start all over again, with somebody else
 
Verse 3:
 
Every time we're stuck in struggle I'm down for the count that day
Every time I dream of quick fix I'm assuaged
Now I know it's hard when it's through and I'm damned if I don't, no quick fix way
What formerly was treatment silent's now outdated
 
My tendency to want to run feels unnatural now
The urgency to want to give to you what I want most feels good and I know
 
CHORUS:2x
The only way out is through
The faster we're in the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll feel better
The only way out is through ultimately
