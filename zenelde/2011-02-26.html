Intro: F5  Bb5  C5  x4

          F5          Bb5   C5
I got to have a shot

   F5               Bb5   C5
Of what you got is oh so sweet
           F5           Bb5  C5
You got to make it hot
       F5          Bb5      C5
Like a boomerang I need a repeat

Bb5
Gimme all your lovin'
F5(v2)                        F5  Bb5  C5
All your hugs and kissed too
Bb5
Gimme all your lovin'
F5(v2)                           F5  Bb5  C5    
Don't let up until we're through

You got to whip it up
And hit me like a ton of lead
If I blow me top
Will you let it go to your head?

Bb5
Gimme all your lovin'
F5(v2)                        F5  Bb5  C5
All your hugs and kissed too
Bb5
Gimme all your lovin'
F5(v2)                           F5  Bb5  C5    
Don't let up until we're through

Solo:
C5  F5(v2)  G5  C5  F5(v2)  G5  C5  F5  Bb5  C5  F5  Bb5  C5

You got to move it up
And use it like a screwball would
You got to pack it up
Work it like a new boy should
