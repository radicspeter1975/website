She says to me it's gonna be alright
Tie me down and tape open my eyes
Well that's okay, I'm not Sally Joe
She seems to me to know which way to go

It's alright, it's fine, no really, let's go
It's all good, alright, no really, let's roll

She says to me it's gonna be alright
Everybody cuts their line
Well that's okay I know where to go
That's a girl who loves her snow

Yeah

It's alright, it's fine, alright let's go
It's all cool, I'm fine, alright let's roll

I went to sleep last night with my hands
Tied to my bed posts I am a man
Everyone, everyone from town
All day long they call me a clown it's a
Served in foreign lands, everybody is a plant now

Aghhhhhhh

It's alright, it's fine, alright, let's go
It's all good, it's cool, alright, let's roll
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, okay now
It's alright, it's fine, alright, let's go
