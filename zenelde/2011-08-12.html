[Actually in A; capo at the 2nd fret]

G   G   Em   C     G   G   Em   C
[intro]

G               G      Em              C
  She makes his coffee, she makes his bed
G              G       Em              C
  She does the laundry, she keeps him fed
D              D                Am               Am
  When she was twenty-one she wore her mother's lace
D             D           Em  - C       D
  She said forever with a smile upon her face

She does the carpool, she PTA's
Doctors and dentists, she drives all day
When she was twenty-nine she delivered number three
And every christmas card showed a perfect family

G        D                  C               D             G
  Everything runs right on time, years of practice and design
          D               C                     D
Spit and polish till it shines, he thinks he'll keep her
G        D            C             D                G
  Everything is so benign, safest place you'll ever find
        D                     C                    D
God forbid you'd change your mind, he thinks he'll keep her
G   G   Em   C
[instrumental]

She packs his suitcase, she sits and waits
With no expression upon her face
When she was thirty-six she met him at the door
She said, "I'm sorry, I don't love you anymore"

Everything runs right on time, years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines, he thinks he'll keep her
Everything is so benign, safest place you'll ever find
God forbid you'd change your mind, he thinks he'll keep her
[4 bars of instrumental]

    D                  D             Am               Am
For fifteen years she had a job and not one raise in pay
D                   D            Em - C     D
  Now she's in the typing pool at minimum wage

Everything runs right on time, years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines, he thinks he'll keep her
Everything is so benign, safest place you'll ever find
At least until you change your mind, he thinks he'll keep her

G  G  Em  C    G  G  Em  C    G  G  Em  C    G  G  Em  C-D   G
