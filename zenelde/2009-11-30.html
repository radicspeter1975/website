    F*                              Am/E
    Bravely I look further than I see
    Am                              Bb
    Knowing things I know I cannot be, not now
    F*                              Am/E
    I'm so aware of where I am,
    Am                                              Bb
    but I don't know where that is, and there's something right in front of me and I
     
    Bb                       C                         Bb
    Touch the fingers of my hand, and I wonder if it's me
                         F                  C
    Holding on and on to theories of prosperity, someone who can promise me
     Am                     Bb
                    I believe in me
     
    F*                              Am/E
    Tomorrow I was nothing, yesterday I'll be
    Am                              Bb
    Time has fooled me into thinking it's a part of me
    F*                              Am/E
    Nothing in this room but empty space
    Am                              Bb
    No me, no world, no mind, no face
     
    Bb                       C                       Bb
    Touch the fingers of my hand and tell me if it's me
                          F                              C                           Am
    Holding on and on to love, what else is real, a religion that appeals to me, oh
                 Bb
    I believe in me
     
    F        Bb      F              Bb        F
    Can you turn me off for just a second, please
            Gm              Bb
    Turn me into something faceless, weightless, mindless, homeless, vacuum state of peace
     
    F               C                                       Am                      Bb
    On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on, I believe in me (Play twice)
    F                                       C
    Wait for me, I'm nothing on my own
    Am                                      Bb
    I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now
    F                               C
    I'm so aware of everything, but nothing seems for real and
    Am                                              Bb
    As long as you're in front of me then I'll
     
    Bb                          C                                Bb
    I Watch the fingers of our hands, and I'm grateful that it's me
                          F                          C                      Am
    Holding on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
                 Bb
    I believe in me
     
     
    I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now...
    I'm so aware of everything...
