[Verse]
Bm        G
crucified
     Bm          G
for eternal sins
     Bm         G
re-invent myself
         Bm         G
shape my alter skin
       Bm                G
try to break the mold
Bm            G
severed hold
Bm                            G
first you find your threshold bevels
Bm                        G
breathing out your toxic levels
Bm                G
long slow rope is hangin
Bm                 G
now we know what's comin
 
[Chorus]
D
oh superman
Bm
where have you gone
E                  A
with a little more time
      G
and a six leaf clover
E                  A
just a little more head
   G
to make you bolder
E                  A     G
just a little more sound
F
been playing tricks you know
        G

       Bm           G
we destroy ourselves
   Bm         G
to rise again
     Bm           G
open up yourself
       Bm           G
like a jesus son
         Bm              G
only way out is through
Bm            G
way past you
Bm                     G
first you get to human levels
Bm                              G
run right through your bullshit pedals
Bm                G
long slow rope is hanging
Bm                 G
now we know what's coming
 
[Chorus 2]
D
oh superman
Bm
where have you gone
E                  A
with a little more time
      G
and a six leaf clover
E                  A
just a little more head
   G
to make you bolder
E                  A     G
just a little more sound
E                  A    G
just a little more sound

E                  A
