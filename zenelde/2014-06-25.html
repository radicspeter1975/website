egy hanggal mélyebben (G=F)

G                          em
As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
    C                               G
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'

I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said "stand and deliver or the devil he may take you"

I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me, no never would she leave me
For the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy

Mush-a rain dum a doo dum a da
    C
Whack for my daddy-o
    C
Whack for my daddy-o
    G
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' my Molly with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels

Mush-a rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Yeah, yeah whiskey!

Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'
And some men like ta hear, ta hear a cannon ball a roarin'
Me I like sleepin', 'specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain yeah

Mush-a rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
