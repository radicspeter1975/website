[Verse 1]
                A                 A
The lights are on, but you're not home
     G                 G
Your mind, is not your own
           D                 D
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
        A                A
Another kiss, is what it takes
 
[Verse 2]
          A                A
You can't sleep, you can't eat
           G                 G
There's no doubt, you're in deep
               D                  D
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
        A               A
Another kiss is all you need
 
[Chorus]
      F#m                             D                     A
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah!
F#m                            D
Closer to the truth to say you can't get enough

[Verse 3]
             A                   A
You see the signs, but you can't read
               G              G
You're running at a different speed
           D                 D
Your heart beats, in double time
        A                  A
Another kiss and you'll be mine
 
[Verse 4]
            A                   A
A one-track mind, you can't be saved
      G                 G
Oblivion, is all you crave
           D             D
If there's some left for you
         A             A
You don't mind if you do
 
[Chorus]
      F#m                             D                     A
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah!
F#m                            D
Closer to the truth to say you   can't get enough
           D5            Dsus2          D               D5 D5

Your will, is not your own
