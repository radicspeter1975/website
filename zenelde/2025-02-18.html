Don't wanna be an American idiot
                                              A D G D A G
Don't want a nation that under the new media
                                        A D G D A G
And can you hear the sound of hysteria

The subliminal mindfuck America
 
[Chorus]

Welcome to a new kind of tension
A
All across the alien nation
E                            A
Everything isn't meant to be okay
D
Television dreams of tomorrow
A
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
E
For that's enough to argue

And sing along in the age of paranoia
