This plus a piano version, for the "D C# C B", only play the note, not the chord.

[Verse]
D                 C#     C             B
  There's nothing that i    wanna do
D                 C#     C             B
  More than get alone and  be with you
D              C#             C          B
  Trouble with dreams is they don't come true
D               C#            C           B
  And when they do they can't catch up to you
 
[Chorus]
G     D            F          C
  You don't need a thing from me
G       D              F        C
  But i need something big from you
           Am
'cause you know i've got
   Am               F   G
An awful lot of big dreams
 
[Instrumental]
Riff x1
 
[Verse]
D             C#     C      B
  I'm walking down a lonely road
D             C#        C         B
  Clear to me now but i was never told
D              C#             C    B
  Trouble with dreams is you never know
D              C#             C      B
  When to hold on and when to let go
 
[Chorus]
G     D         F         C
  If you let me down it's alright
G     D                F             C
  At least that leaves something for me
           Am
'cause you know i've got
   Am               F   G
An awful lot of big dreams
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse]
D             C#         C          B
  This is the life that i must lead now
D          C#          C      B
  Crossing fingers and wiping brow
D              C#            C        B
  Trouble with dreams is you can't pretend
D               C#            C      B
  Something with no beginning has an end
 
[Chorus]
G     D            F          C
  You don't need a thing from me
G       D              F        C
  But i need something big from you
           Am
'cause you know i've got
   Am               F   G
An awful lot of big dreams
