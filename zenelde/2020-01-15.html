(kb. 50 centtel magasabban)
  C                       F
Remember that tanktop you bought me
C                     Fadd9
 You wrote 'You're gorgeous' on it
C                    F
You took me to your rented motor car
C                        Fadd9
 And filmed me on the bonnet
C                       F
 You got me to hitch my knees up
C                   Fadd9
 And pulled my legs apart
C                   F
 You took an instamatic camera
C                                Fadd9
 And pulled my sleeves around my heart

[Chorus]

        C      F             C               Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
        C      F           C                  Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me through

[Verse]

C                          F
  You said my clothes were sexy
C                  Fadd9
  You tore away my shirt
C                              F
  You rubbed an ice-cube on my chest
C                        Fadd9
  And snapped me 'til it hurt

[Chorus]

        C      F             C               Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
        C      F             C                Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, our love will see us through
        C      F             C               Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
        C      F           C                  Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me through

[Instrumental]

C  F  C  Fadd9 x 3
        C                       F
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba ba
        C                       Fadd9
ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba  a ha

[Verse]

C                   F
  You said I wasn't cheap
C                    Fadd9
  You paid me twenty pounds
C                             F
  You promised to put me in a magazine
C                          Fadd9
  On every table, in every lounge

[Chorus]

        C      F             C               Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
        C      F           C                  Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me through

        C      F             C               Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
        C      F           C                   Fadd9              C
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
Fadd9              C        Fadd9              C
know you'll get me through, know you'll get me through
Fadd9               C                  F
know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
  C                   Fadd9               C                  Fadd9
I know you'll get me, know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
        C      F             C               Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
        C      F           C                  Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me through
        C      F             C               Fadd9
Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you
        C      F           C                   Fadd9              C
Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
