G            Em                 Em/D    C           
She plays it hard, she plays it tough
Am         D7                 G
But that's enough the love is over
G            Em                 Em/D     C  
She broke his heart and that is rough
Am         D7               G      Cmaj7
But in the end he'll soon recover
Am/F#  B7      Em
The romance is over
