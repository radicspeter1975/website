Intro: Em D

Em                           Am
It's easy to see, it's easy to see
        D                              G
To see only white where colour should be

Em                            Am
It's easy to feel, it's easy to feel
         D                                G
But it's not good enough, even though it's real

Bm           Am
Oh, please stay awake

          D                        G
And then we can drink some Ocean Spray

AFTER CHORUS:   G#    F     G

It's easy to breathe, it's easy to grieve
To breathe only air where life should be
It's easy to laugh, it's easy to cry
To cry so so hard that it can't be denied
