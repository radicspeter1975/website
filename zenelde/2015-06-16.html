<i>"Ahhh. Goody two shoes. Beddy bye boes time again. Good night honey." 
"Sweet dreams to you."</i>

[D] [E]  I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
[G] [G] [G] [A] been hunted by A million screams
[C] [C] [C] [D] but I can hear the marching feet
[D] [D] [D] [E] they're moving into the street.

[D] [D] [D] [E] Now did you read the news today ?
[G] [G] [G] [A] They say the danger's gone away.
[C] [C] [C] [D] But I can see the fire's still alight
[D] [D] [D] [E] burning into the night.
 
There's [D] too many [Em] men [G] too many [A] people making
[D] too many [Em] problems [G] and [A] not much
[D] love to go [Em] round [G] can't you [A] see this is a
[D] land of con-[Em]-fusion [G] [D]

[Em] So, [C] this is the [D] world we live in
[Em] [C] and these are the [D] hands we're given
[Em] [C] Use them and [D] let's start trying
[Em] [C] to make it a [D] place worth living [A] in [Am]

[D] [D] [D] [E] Oh superman, where are you now,
[G] [G] [G] [A] when everything's gone wrong somehow?
[C] [C] [C] [D] The man of steel, men of power
[D] [D] [D] [E] are losing control by the hour.

[D] This is the [Em] time, [G] this is the [A] place,
so we [D] look for the [Em] future. [G] But there's [A] not much
[D] love to go [Em] around. [G] Tell me [A] why this is a
[D] land of con-[Em]-fusion?

[Em] So, [C] this is the [D] world we live in
[Em] [C] and these are the [D] hands we're given
[Em] [C] Use them and [D] let's start trying
[Em] [C] to make it a [D] place worth living [A] in [Am]

[Em] and [C] these are the [D] names we're given.
[Em] [C] Stand up and [D] let's start showing
[Em] [C] just where our [D] lives are going [A] to [Am]

<i>"Morning, dear!" 
"Ah! Hey, Nancy, what a terrible dream. I'm parched. 
Ahh, that's better! Uh, I could use another one of those." 
"Ah, that's one heck of a nurse!"</i>
