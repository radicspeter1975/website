| Em  B |  Em   |  F#   |   B   |

Em     B         Em
Sick, tired and homeless
     F#              B
with no one here to sing for
Em    B         Em
tired of being weightless
    F#                 B           Em
for all these looking good boys

C        D             G              Em
You can always say my attic has its charm
C        D              G            Em
You can always say you did no major harm

You can always say that summer had its charm

and that you did no major harm
oh, spare me if you please

Em     B          Em
Sick, tired and sleepless
      F#              B
with no one else to shine for
Em      B       Em
sick of all my distress
    F#                 B           Em
but I won't show I'm still poor

Symptoms are so deep
something here's so wrong
nothing is complete
nowhere to belong
aymptoms are so deep
I think I'd better stay
here on my own
so spare me if you please
