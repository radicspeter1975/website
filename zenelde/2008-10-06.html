Am             G                Am      F  G
Traveling in a fried-out combie
Am          G                   Am      F  G
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
Am                    G          Am       F  G
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
Am          G              Am        F  G
She took me in and gave me breakfast

And she said,

C                G                 Am      F  G
Do you come from a land down under? 
C           G            Am       F  G
Where women glow and men plunder? 
C              G                 Am       F  G
Cant you hear, cant you hear the thunder? 
C               G               Am      F  G
You better run, you better take cover.

Am                G        Am       F  G
Buying bread from a man in brussels
Am              G                Am      F  G
He was six foot four and full of muscles
Am             G                   Am      F  G
I said, do you speak-a my language? 
Am             G                      Am       F  G
He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich

And he said,

C                G                 Am      F  G
Do you come from a land down under? 
C           G            Am       F  G
Where women glow and men plunder? 
C              G                 Am       F  G
Cant you hear, cant you hear the thunder? 
C               G               Am      F  G
You better run, you better take cover.

Am         G            Am      F  G
Lying in a den in bombay
Am                G               Am      F  G
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
Am                 G                 Am       F  G
I said to the man, are you trying to tempt me
Am        G                     Am      F  G
Because I come from the land of plenty? 

And he said,

C                G                 Am      F  G
Do you come from a land down under?     (oh yeah yeah)
C           G            Am       F  G
Where women glow and men plunder? 
C              G                 Am       F  G
Cant you hear, cant you hear the thunder? 
C               G               Am      F  G
You better run, you better take cover.
