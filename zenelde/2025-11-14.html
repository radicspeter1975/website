[Verse 1]
Am
On the hard fast train, on the road to gain
Something gets right through to your telling bone
There's a sudden itch, an electric twitch
Sometimes I swear this body's got a mind of it's own
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G
This is the naked truth, this is the light
F                              E
There's only one place left to go
 
[Chorus]
Am       Dm
Auberge, Auberge
Am       Dm
Auberge, Auberge
 
[Verse 2]
Am
You meet the silent type, on a windy trail
With a shiny cloak and an unseen silver dagger
You can talk till you ache, give yourself one more break
You can tell by the look on his face that it just doesn't matter
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G
'Cause, this is the naked truth, this is the light
F                              E
There's only one place left to go
 
[Chorus]
Am       Dm
Auberge, Auberge
Am       Dm
Auberge, Auberge

[Verse 3]
Am
Give me a weekend, give me a day
Don't like what I'm seeing though I hear what you say
Think with a dagger, and you'll die on your knees
Begging for mercy, saying please, mister please!
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G
'Cause, this is the naked truth, this is the light
F                              E
There's only one place left to go
 
[Chorus]
Am       Dm
Auberge, Auberge
Am       Dm
Auberge, Auberge
 
[Outro]
Am       Dm
Auberge, Auberge
Am       Dm
Auberge, Auberge
Am       Dm
Auberge, Auberge
Am       Dm
Auberge, Auberge
Dm
Auberge!
