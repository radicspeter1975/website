am G F C

        C
You can make the sun turn purple
        F
You can make the sea turn turtle
        G#            Bb                    C
But you know you can never make me love you more

You can turn wine into water
And sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

        C
Let the sky fall down
        Bb
Let the leaves turn brown
(F)         G#          Bb                    C
Still you know you can never make me love you more

Let the redwoods die
Let the wells run dry
Still you know you can never make me love you more
You can make dew into diamonds
Or pacify the lions
But you know you can never make me love you more
You can make me dance to order
My sex hung, torn and quartered
But you know you can never make me love you more
Let the sky fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
Still you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die
Let the wells run dry
Still you know you can never make me love you more
Let the sky fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
Still you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die
Let the wells run dry
Still you know you can never make me love you more
