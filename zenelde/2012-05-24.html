fél hanggal mélyebben B=Bb

 B7                     E7  
Teenage angst has paid off well 
F#7               E7 
Now I'm bored and old 
B7              E7
Self-appointed judges judge 
 F#7                 E7 
More than they have sold 

If she floats than she is not 
A witch like we had thought 
A down payment on another 
One at Salem's lot 

 A         C#(m)          A   
Serve the servants, oh no    x4
       F#         G         (C#)
That legendary divorce is such a bore 

As my bones grew they did hurt 
They hurt really bad 
I tried hard to have a father 
But instead I had a dad 

I just want you to know that I 
Don't hate you anymore 
There is nothing I could say 
That I haven't thought before 

Serve the servants, oh no 
That legendary divorce is such a bore
