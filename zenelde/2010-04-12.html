        D        F#m
Let it slide overhead
          A                        G
When I believe in you my soul can rest
        D                  F#m
But as love that's really love
           A                G
can never fail but fail it does
          D             F#m
When we shine like the sun
             A                  G
You seem the only one my only friend
Em                    C
You're so pretty in white
                    Em
pretty when you're faithful
               C
So pretty in white
                    Am
pretty when you're faithful
 F
faithful

D  F#m

     D             F#m
I resigned from myself
         A              G
Took a break as someone else
D                       F#m
It's like we've come undone
                      A       G
But I've only just become inflatable for you

Em                    C
You're so pretty in white
                    Em
pretty when you're faithful
               C
So pretty in white
                    Am
pretty when you're faithful
 F        Em
faithful

Solo:
D  F#m A  G

         D                F#m
I don't mind most of the time
                 A        G
But you push me so far inside

Em                    C
You're so pretty in white
                    Em
pretty when you're faithful
Em             C
so pretty in white
                    Em
pretty when you're faithful
Em             C
so pretty in white
                    Em
pretty when you're faithful
Em             C
so pretty in white
                    Am
pretty when you're faithful
             F
when you´re faithful
             Em
when you´re faithful
