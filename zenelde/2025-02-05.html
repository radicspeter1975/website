Capo 1 (em=fm)
 
[Verse 1]
Em                                                                Am
Steve walks warily down the street, with the brim pulled way down low
Em                                                               Am
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet, Machine guns ready to go
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C                      G
Are you ready, Are you ready for this
C                      G
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
C                      G            Am                 B
Out of the doorway the bullets rip, to the sound of the beat
 
[Chorus]
Em                   Am
Another one bites the dust
Em                   Am
Another one bites the dust
Em                    Em                                         Am
And another one gone, and another one gone, Another one bites the dust
F#m            A
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
                      B7
Another one bites the dust
 
[Verse 2]
Em                                                                Am
How do you think I'm going to get along, Without you, when you're gone
Em                                                            Am
You took me for everything that I had, And kicked me out on my own
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C                      G
Are you happy, are you satisfied
C                      G
How long can you stand the heat
C                    G              Am                 B
Out of the doorway the bullets rip, to the sound of the beat
 
[Chorus]
Em                   Am
Another one bites the dust
Em                   Am
Another one bites the dust
Em                                                               Am
And another one gone, and another one gone, Another one bites the dust
F#m            A
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
                      B7
Another one bites the dust
 
[Link]
A                     B
Another one bites the dust
A                     B
Another one bites the dust
A                     B
Another one bites the dust
A                     B
Another one bites the dust
 
[Verse 3]
Em                                                                Am
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man, And bring him to the ground
Em
You can beat him, You can cheat him, You can treat him bad and leave him
          Am
When he's down
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C                        G
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
C                        G
I'm standing on my own two feet
C                        G          A                            B
Out of the doorway the bullets rip, Repeating to the sound of the beat, oh yeah
 
[Outro]
A                     B
Another one bites the dust
A                     B
Another one bites the dust
Em                                                               Am
And another one gone, and another one gone, Another one bites the dust
F#m            A
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
                      B
Another one bites the dust
