            D7                    D7            D7  D7
Well it's a strange old game, you learn it slow
D7                        D7          D7  D7
One step forward and it's back you go
       D7                               D7                    D7  D7
You're standing on the throttle, you're standing on the brake
D7                      D7
 In the groove till you make a mistake

D7                    D7         D7                    G7
 Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug
D7             D7                     D7                       C   - G
 Sometimes it all comes together baby, sometimes you're just a fool in love
D7                    D7                      D7                    G7
 Sometimes you're the Louisville Slugger baby, sometimes you're the ball
D7             D7                     D7                      C   - G
 Sometimes it all comes together baby, sometimes you're gonna lose it all

You gotta know happy, you gotta know glad
Because you're gonna know lonely and you're gonna know sad
When you're rippin' and a-ridin' and you're coming on strong
You start slippin' and a-slidin' and it all goes wrong

Because sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all falls together baby, sometimes you're a fool in love
Sometimes you're the Louisville Slugger baby, sometimes you're the ball
Sometimes it all comes together baby, sometimes you're gonna lose it all

A7  A7(sus4)  A7  D7    A7  A7  A7  C - G    D7  D7  D7  D7
[guitar solo]

One day you got the glory, and then you got none
One day you're a diamond, and then you're a stone
Everything can change in the blink of an eye
So let the good times roll before we say goodbye

Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all comes together baby, sometimes you're a fool in love
Sometimes you're the Louisville Slugger baby, sometimes you're the ball
Sometimes it all comes together baby, sometimes you're gonna lose it all
Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all comes together baby, sometimes you're a fool in love
Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all comes together baby, sometimes you're just a fool in love
