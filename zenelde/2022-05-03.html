[Verse 1]
 
Bb
That's all I wanted
                              Ab
Something special, something sacred
          Bb
In your eyes
 
For just one moment
                Ab
To be bold and naked
 
At your side
Gb                             Ab
Sometimes I think that you'll never
       Bb
Understand me
Gb                    Ab
Maybe this time is forever
        F
Say it can be
 
Bb
That's all you wanted
                              Ab
Something special, someone sacred
         Bb
In your life
 
Just for one moment
                Ab
To be warm and naked
 
At my side
Gb                             Ab
Sometimes I think that you'll never
       Bb
Understand me
Gb                      Ab
But something tells me together
         F
We'd be happy
 
[Hook]
(Baby)
Bb
I will be your father figure
(Oh baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine
 
(I'd love to)
Ab
I will be your preacher teacher
(Be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind
 
(It would make me)
Bb
I will be your father figure
(Very happy)
I have had enough of crime
 
(Please let me)
Ab
I will be the one who loves you
                  Bb
Until the end of time
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Bb
That's all I wanted
                             Ab
But sometimes love can be mistaken
      Bb
For a crime
 
That's all I wanted
               Ab
Just to see my baby's
          Bb
Blue eyed shine
Gb                        Ab
This time I think that my lover
     Bb
Understands me
Gb                       Ab
If we have faith in each other
            F
Then we can be
 
Strong
 
[Hook]
(Baby)
Bb
I will be your father figure
(Oh baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine
 
(I'd love to)
Ab
I will be your preacher teacher
(Be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind
 
(It would make me)
Bb
I will be your father figure
(Very happy)
I have had enough of crime
 
(Please let me)
Ab
I will be the one who loves you
                  Bb
Until the end of time
 
[Verse 3]
Gb              Ab
If you are the desert
             Gb
I'll be the sea
Gb           Ab
If you ever hunger
            Gb
Hunger for me
Gb                Ab
Whatever you ask for
                  F   Gb
That's what I'll be
               Ab                       Gb
So when you remember the ones who have lied
                    Ab
Who said that they cared?
                          Gb
But then laughed as you cried
           Ab
Beautiful Darling
F
Don't think of me
                    Bb  (solo) Ab
Because all I ever wanted
              Bb               Ab
It's in your eyes baby, baby
                Bb
And love can't lie, no...
   Gb              Ab              Bb
(Greet me with the eyes of a child)
                             Gb
My love is always tell me to...
                          Ab
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile)
          F
Just hold on, hold on
                        Bb
I won't let you go, my baby
