lalalalalalalalalala.. :P
A5              F5      C5         G5
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
A5                F5  C5             G5
And practiced all the things I would say
A5           F5   C5        G5
But she came over I lost my nerve
A5              F5  C5       G5
I took her back and made her dessert
G5 A5 F5  C5             G5
Oh I know I'm being used
A5              F5      C5             G5
That's okay man cause I like the abuse
A5   F5          C5             G5
Oh I know she's playing with me
A5          F5             C5             G5
That's okay cause I've got no self esteem

Vers:2<-- the same chords has Vers:1
We make plans to go out at night
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

D5         Bb5     F5            C5        D5
When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
       Bb5            F5             C5     
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
D5         Bb5     F5           C5       D5
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
       Bb5             F5         C5
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
D5     Bb5   F5             C5      D5
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
      Bb5               F5          C5   D5
But I really think it's better this way
             Bb5   
The more you suffer
C5          G5               F5
The more it shows you really care
         G5  C5/G  G5  C5/G
Right? Yeah-eh-eh

Vers:3
Now I'll relate this little bit
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score
Oh I know I should say no but
It's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem

Refrain again:
When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah-eh-eh
