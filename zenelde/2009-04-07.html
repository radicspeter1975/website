Strumming pattern:
 
e---------------------- (only strum for the D chord)
B----------x-----------
G----------x-----------
D---x-x----x-----------
A---x-x----x----------- (for the D chord, don't play this string...)
E--don't play----------
 
(4 of the above strums equals what you should play for
each chord when it changes) 
 
(on the D/A/D change play 2 strums D, then 2 strums A, then 4 strums D)
 
 
Start strumming A for the intro, come in with
the lyrics on the second strum of the pattern)
 
A                            F#m
Her green plastic watering can
                               D
For her fake chinese rubber plant
              A     D
In the fake plastic earth
A                               F#m 
That she bought from a rubber man
                            D 
In a town full of rubber plans
       A      D 
To get rid of itself
 
             Bm
It wears her out..
             A
It wears her out..
             Bm
It wears her out..
             A
It wears her out
 
A                         F#m
She lives with a broken man
                        D  
A cracked polystyrene man
          A           D  
Who just crumbles and burns
A                   F#m
He used to do surgery
                      D  
For girls in the eighties
            A      D 
But gravity always wins
                 Bm 
And it wears him out..
             A
It wears him out..
             Bm
It wears him out..
      A 
It weeeeeaaaars
 
A                            F#m
She looks like the real thing
                           D
She tastes like the real thing
          A     D    
My fake plastic love
A                         F#m
But I can't help the feeling
                             D
I could blow through the ceiling
           A        D
If I just turn and run
                Bm
And it wears me out
            A
It wears me out
            Bm
It wears me out
            A 
It wears me out
               Bm
And if I could be who you wanted
           A
If I could be who you wanted
       Bm
All the time..
       A
All the time..

A (with more energy)
F#m (with more energy)
D (with more energy, no change this time)
(end on) A
