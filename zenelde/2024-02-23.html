I know how to hurt

I know what to show

The world is not enough
                         Bbm
But it is such a perfect place
             C
to start, my love
              Fm
And if you're strong enough

Together we can take the world
          C
apart, my love

People like us

Know how to survive

If you can't feel alive

We know when to kiss

Then nobody will

apart, my love
