Intro:
Cmaj7-C-Cmaj7-C

 
Cmaj7    C
Fourteen years
Cmaj7  C
Thirty minutes
Aus2           Am
Fifteen seconds I've
Asus2     Am
Held this grudge
 
Eleven songs
Four full journals
Thoughts of punishment
I've expended
 
Not in contact
Not a letter
Such communication
Telepathic
 
You've been vilified
Used as fodder
You deserve a piece
Of every record
 
Dm                   C     Cmaj7-C
But who's it hurting now?
Dm                   C     Cmaj7-C
Who's the one that's stuck?
Dm                 C
Who's it torturing now
Cmaj      C      G           G
With an antique knot in her stomach?
 
CHORUS:
             C           Cmaj7
I want to be big and let go
        Cmaj7                 C
Of this grudge that's grown old
  C                   Cmaj7
All this time I've not known 
      Cmaj7        C
How to rest this bygone
            C        Cmaj7
I wanna be soft and resolved
        Cmaj7         C
Clean of slate and released
           G                   Dsus4
I wanna forgive for the both of us
 
Like an abandoned house
Dusty covered
Furniture
Still intact
 
If I visit it now
Do I simply re-live it
Somehow
gratuitous
 
Dm                      C     Cmaj7-C
But who's still aching now?
Dm                      C     Cmaj7-C
Who's tired of her own voice?
Dm                   C
Who is it weighing down 
Cmaj      C        G           G
With no gift from time of said healing
 
CHORUS:
             C           Cmaj7
I want to be big and let go
        Cmaj7                 C
Of this grudge that's grown old
  C                   Cmaj7
All this time I've not known 
      Cmaj7        C
How to rest this bygone
            C        Cmaj7
I wanna be soft and resolved
        Cmaj7         C
Clean of slate and released
           G                   Dsus4
I wanna forgive for the both of us
 
       Cmaj        C
Maybe as I cut the cord
Dsus4                   C
Veils will lift from my eyes
       Cmaj7           C
Maybe as I lay this to rest
     Aus2           C             G
Dead weight off my shoulders will rise
 
Here I sit
Much determined
Ever ill-equipped
To draw this curtain
 
How this has entertained
Validated
And has served me well
Ever the victim
 
Dm                      C     Cmaj7-C
But who's done whining now?
Dm                  C     Cmaj7-C
Who's ready to put down
Dm                        C
This load I've carried longer 
    Cmaj-C G           G
than I had cared to remember
 
CHORUS:
             C           Cmaj7
I want to be big and let go
        Cmaj7                 C
Of this grudge that's grown old
          C                Cmaj7
For this life of me I've not known 
      Cmaj7        C
How to rest this bygone
            C        Cmaj7
I wanna be soft and resolved
        Cmaj7         C
Clean of slate and released
           G                   Dsus4
I wanna forgive for the both of us    (x2)
 
G-Dus4
