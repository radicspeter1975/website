Intro: F#m  A  F#m  A  C#m  D (repeat)

Verse:
F#m             A
Swinging in the backyard
F#m             A
Pull up in your fast car
C#m          D
Whistling my name

F#m       A
Open up a beer
        F#m          A
And you take it over here
           C#m   D
And play a video game

    F#m             A
I'm in his favorite sun dress
F#m             A
Watching me get undressed
C#m            D
Take that body downtown
F#m           A
I say you the bestest
F#m           A
Lean in for a big kiss
C#m              D
Put his favorite perfume on
          C#m   D
Go play a video game

Chorus:
E
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
                   D
I tell you all the time
                                A
Heaven is a place on earth with you
                           G       F#m
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
D
Honey, is that true?
                             A
It's better than I ever even knew
                            G         F#m
They say that the world was built for two
                         D              Dm
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
             F#m
Baby now you do

F#m  A  F#m  A  C#m  D

Verse:
F#m            A
Singing in the old bars
F#m               A
Swinging with the old stars
C#m            D
Living for the fame

F#m            A
Kissing in the blue dark
F#m              A
Playing pool and wild darts
C#m   D
Video games

F#m                A
He holds me in his big arms
F#m            A
Drunk and I am seeing stars
C#m           D
This is all I think of

F#m              A
Watching all our friends fall
F#m            A
In and out of Old Paul's
C#m         D
This is my idea of fun
        C#m   D
Playing video games

Chorus:
E
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
                   D
I tell you all the time

Heaven is a place on earth with you

Tell me all the things you want to do
