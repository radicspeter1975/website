Verse]
  D    A   Em             D           A          Em
Your love alone – is not enough not enough not enough
 D      A         Em            D              A            Em
When times get tough they get tough they get tough they get tough
 
   G                            D            A             Em
Trade all your heroes in for ghosts in for ghosts in for ghosts
  G                                  D             A            Em
They’re always the one’s who love you most love you most love you most
 
Your love alone – is not enough not enough not enough
It’s what you felt it’s what you said what you said what you said
 
You said the sky would fall on you fall on you fall on you
Through all the pain your eyes stayed Blue they stayed Blue Baby Blue
 
[Chorus]
  A                                  Em
But your love alone won’t save the world
   G                          D
You knew the secret of the universe
   A                        Em
Despite it all you made it worse
  G                         G
It left you lonely it left you cursed
 
 
[Verse]
You stole the sun straight from my heart from my heart from heart
With no excuses just fell apart fell apart fell apart
 
No you won’t make a mess of me mess of me mess of me
For you’re as blind as a man can be man can be man can be
 
[Chorus]
I could have seen for miles and miles
I could have made you feel alive
I could have placed us in exile
I could have shown you how too cry
 
Your love alone is not enough
Your love alone is not enough
