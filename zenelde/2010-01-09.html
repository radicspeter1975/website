A, E, F#mi, D

E Heaven F#mi kicked you out D
E You wouldnt F#mi wear a tie D

C# Starring at the H pictures by G yourself
C# At something that you H never had you D never get

Going A nowhere E
Going F#mi nowhere D

E You can get F#mi drunk on life D
E You can drunk F#mi every night D

C# Shouting at the H world you never Gchange
C# But it what H inside youve got the D rearrange

Going A nowhere E
Going F#m nowhere D

E Heaven F#mi kicked you out D
E Heaven F#mi kicked you out D

A, E, F#mi, D

C# Making up the H worse you never G get
C# Loosing every H single thing you D ever had

Going A nowhere E
Going F#mi nowhere D
