Dm                                C
The Summer sun is fading as the year grows cold
Bb     Am     Bb               C
   And darker days are drawing near
Bb                              C     (pause)
The winter winds will be much colder
               Dm
Now you're not here

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear.
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here.

A#     F        D#        Dm
Like a song through the trees you came to love me
A#      F         D#                Dm    A#7
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year.
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now

          Dm                  C
'Cause you're not here. 'Cause you're not here.
          Dm
'Cause you're not here.

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn...

          Dm                  C
'Cause you're not here. 'Cause you're not here.
          Dm
'Cause you're not here.  (repeat and fade)
