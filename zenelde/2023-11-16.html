Oh, baby child...
 
        E
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky 
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
             A                D
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon 
            E
You know I don't see you when she walks in the room 
 
E
It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help 
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
           A                       D
They say a secret is something you tell one other person 
   E
So I'm telling you, child 
 
C#m   E                A
Love...we shine like a Burning star We're falling from the 
C#m   E A
Sky…  Tonight A man will 
C#m            E                          A
Beg A man will crawl On the sheer face of love Like a fly on a wall 
A                 E
It's no secret at all 
 
        E
It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest 
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
      A                           D
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief 
    E
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief 
 
C#m   E                A
Love...we shine like a Burning star We're falling from the 
C#m   E A
Sky…  Tonight A man will 
C#m             E                           A
Rise A man will fall from the sheer face of love Like a fly from a wall 
A                 E
It's no secret at all

A                 E
It's no secret at all

Oh, yeah! It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky 
The universe exploded 'cause of one man's lie
        Em                 E
Look, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta change 
        Em                 E
There's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange
 
Em E Em E Em E
