E   A - B
Everyone has said that i might go

'cos my red suitcase and my ray-bans
Weren't quite so
I'd bear the heavy wind and rain that falls
I'll never come back again
'cos you know i laugh when winter shows her hand
Well, that picture framed the saddest thing you'll see
But it bought me time and a place that love could be
And since i'm going now please rearrange
'cos i'd like to think that things have changed
I don't believe you'll be open anymore

E       G#
Tell me if, you want to see
A           E
A world outside your window
A           E       B
A world outside your window isn't free

E       G#          A       E
And tell me if you wanna catch that feeling of redemption
A       E       B       E
That feeling of redemption doesn't do much for me

Well, everyone was hoping you would stay a while
Tell us 'bout that great land in the south
I see that man - now ain't he under offer?
I tell you child you go wash out your mouth

Tell me if, you want to see
A world outside your window
A world outside your window isn't free
And tell me if you wanna catch that feeling of redemption
That feeling of redemption doesn't do much for me

What can you say
I'm hiding in the belfry
What can you say - i want to catch time
How can you say you know anything about me
Well i knew about you - but i won't care about you

Everyone has come to see. well somethings have to do
Flowers out for this photographic haunt, but they all pass me by
But the age is not a funny game, it don't give such a buzz
And when i winced with ignorance
I had to kiss this dust
