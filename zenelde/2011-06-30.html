F               Bbsus2
Lay dagger dead inside a lonely bed

F                  Bbsus2
Trying to hide the hole inside my head

F                        Bbsus2
Watching the stars slide down to reach the end

F                   Bbsus2
The sleep is not my friend

F                     Gm7
Drinking champagne to forget yesterday

         Amaug5       Bbsus2
'Cause I remember the way, the way, the way

   F                  Gm7
It ended the day, the day, the day, the day

     Amaug5         Bbsus2
That I walked away, away, away, away

Csus4                          Bbsus2
Drinking champagne made by the angel

    Csus4               Bbsus2
Who goes by the name of Glittering Gabriel

Csus4              Bbsus2              Csus4
Drinking champagne made of an angel's tears and pain

Bsus2
But I feel celestial

F                   Bbsus2
Elderly stars slide down the morning sky

F                Bbsus2
Slipping away to find a place to die

F                 Bbsus2
I wonder when the night will reach its end

F                   Bbsus2
The sleep is not my friend

F                  Gm7
Drinking champagne meant for a wedding

  Amaug5                Bbsus2
A toast to the bride, a fairytale ending

F                     Gm7
Drinking champagne, a bottle to myself

Amaug5             Bbsus2
Savor the taste of fabricated wealth
