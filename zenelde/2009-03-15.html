 Am
To me
            C
Coming from you,
F           D7          Am          C
Friend is a four letter word
F           D7              Am
End is the only part of the word
       C
That I heard,
        F         D7

Verse 2 as 1

Bridge
 Em
When I go fishing
        Am
for the words
     Em                Am
I am wishing you would say to me,
     F           C
I am really only praying that
    G                    D7
The words you'll soon be saying
      Am
Might betray
    Em           Am
The way you feel about me
