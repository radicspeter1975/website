[Intro]
| G | G | G | G
 
[Verse 1]
 
     G              G4       G             G4
I'm broke but I'm happy, I'm poor but I'm kind
     G              G4       G
I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah
     G              G4           G               G4
I'm high but I'm grounded, I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed
     G              G4      G
I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby
 
[Chorus]
                      F
And what it all comes down to
C                               G            G4   G
  Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine
                F
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
        C                   D         G   G4  G
And the other one is givin' a high five
 
[Verse 2]
        G            G4         G             G4
I feel drunk but I'm sober, I'm young and I'm underpaid
    G             G4         G
I'm tired but I'm workin', yeah
  G            G4            G            G4
I care but I'm restless, I'm here but I'm really gone
    G             G4      G
I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby
 
[Chorus]
                      F
And what it all comes down to
C                               G         G4   G
  Is that everything's gonna be quite alright
                F
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
        C                     D           G  G4  G
And the other one is flickin' a cigarette
 
[Instrumental] (Harmonica)
| G | G | G | G |
| G | G | G | G
 
[Chorus]
                      F
And what it all comes down to
C                                      G           G4   G
  Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
                F
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
        C                   D           G  G4  G
And the other one is givin' a peace sign
 
[Verse 3]
    G            G4           G             G4
I'm free but I'm focused, I'm green but I'm wise
    G            G4         G
I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby
    G            G4           G             G4
I'm sad but I'm laughin', I'm brave but I'm chickenshit
    G            G4       G
I'm sick but I'm pretty, baby
 
[Chorus]
                      F
And what it all boils down to
C                                        G           G4  G
  Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
               F
Well, I've got one hand in my pocket
        C                    D     G  G4  G
And the other one is playin' a piano
 
                      F                      C
And what it all comes down to, my friend, yeah
                          G        G4   G
Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine
                F
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
        C                    D        G
And the other one is hailing a taxi cab
