[Verse]
A       F                   A     F
We do believe it ends right here
A        F                G        F
The orchestration and the dream is clear
A         F                     A       F
Shuttle departs and they're all there
A          F               G        F
Everyone's cracking up but we don't care
 
[Chorus]
C
And we agree
G
It's what we need
Am       F
Orchestrareal
 
[Verse]
A           F               A       F
Whisper the cymbals ride on in
A                      F                     G       F
Though this time we'll trade the strings for old one-tens
A               F               A        F
Headphones will assure position when
A                       F        G     F
The crowd fades and the overture begins
 
[Chorus]
C
And we agree
G
It's what we need
Am       F
Orchestrareal
C
And we agree
G
It's what we need
Am       F

[Verse]
A         F                  A      F
I don't believe the way this feels
A          F               G        F
Slight alterations leave enraptured ears
A                 F                A     F
Headphones will insure possessions when
A                       F          G     F
The crowd fades and the overture begins
 
[Chorus]
C
And we agree

And we agree

It's what we need
