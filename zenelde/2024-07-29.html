egy hanggal mélyebben: G=F

Intro / végig: G D Am C x2
 
       G                    D
Sirens ring, the shots ring out
           Am                 C
A stranger cries, screams out loud
         G                         D
I had my world strapped against my back
          Am                       C
I held my hands, never knew how to act
 
 
Chorus:
            G
    And the same black line that was drawn on you
        D
    Was drawn on me
                            Am
    And now it's drawin' me in
               C
    6th Avenue heartache
 
Solo Here: G D Am C x1
 
      G                 D
Below me was a homeless man
            Am           C
I'm singin' songs I knew complete
              G                   D
On the steps alone, his guitar in hand
           Am                    C
It's fifty years, stood where he stands
 
Chorus:
            G
    And the same black line that was drawn on you
        D
    Was drawn on me
                            Am
    And now it's drawin' me in
               C
    6th Avenue heartache
 
Chorus:
            G
    And the same black line that was drawn on you
        D
    Was drawn on me
                            Am
    And now it's drawin' me in
               C
    6th Avenue heartache
 
            G             D
Now walkin' home on those streets
          Am            C
The river winds move my feet
       G                          D
Subway steam, like silhouettes in dreams
              Am                C
They stood by me, just like moonbeams
 
Chorus:
            G
    And the same black line that was drawn on you
        D
    Was drawn on me
                            Am
    And now it's drawin' me in
               C
    6th Avenue heartache
 
Chorus:
            G
    And the same black line that was drawn on you
        D
    Was drawn on me
                            Am
    And now it's drawin' me in
               C
    6th Avenue heartache
 
Solo: G D Am C
 
             G                      D
Look out the window, down upon that street
                Am                C
And gone like a midnight was that man
                  G                         D
But I see his six strings laid against that wall
            Am                       C
And all his things, they all look so small
                 G                     D
I got my fingers crossed on a shooting star
          Am            C
Just like me-just moved on
 
Repeat Chorus till fade:
 
Chorus:
            G
    And the same black line that was drawn on you
        D
    Was drawn on me
                            Am
    And now it's drawin' me in
               C
    6th Avenue heartache
