Intro:  C  Em  C  Em
 
C                                   Em
from behind these walls I hear your song, oh sweet words
C                                    Em
the music that you play lights up my world
                       C
the sweetest that I've heard
                  Am                   Em      G
could it be that I've been touched and turned, oh lord please
Am       F                   Dm
finally, finally things are changing
 
             C                     Am
this land is mine but I'll let you rule
             Em               G
I'll let you navigate and demand
        C           Am                 Em      G
just as long as you know, this land is mine
             C               Am
so find your home and settle in
       Em               G
oh I'm ready to let you in
        C          Am                Em        G
just as long as we know, this land is mine
 
C               Am            Em        G?
after all the battles and the wars, the scars and loss
C               Am               Em
I am still the queen of my domain
    G                 C
and feeling stronger now
                     Am               Em    G
the walls are down a little more each day, since you came
Am       F                   Dm
finally, finally things are changing
 
             C                     Am
this land is mine but I'll let you rule
             Em               G
I'll let you navigate and demand
        C           Am                 Em      G
just as long as you know, this land is mine
             C               Am
so find your home and settle in
       Em               G
oh I'm ready to let you in
        C          Am                Em        G
just as long as we know, this land is mine
 
    C                     Am       Em       Dm
for all the days I've travelled alone
          C                     Am          Em       Dm
  in this cold and colourless place till now
(no chord)
it's what I had to pay

             C                     Am
this land is mine but I'll let you rule
             Em               G
I'll let you navigate and demand
        C           Am                 Em      G
just as long as you know, this land is mine
             C               Am
so find your home and settle in
       Em               G
oh I'm ready to let you in
        C          Am                Em        G
just as long as we know, this land is mine

[Chorus again but just play chords once, no strumming, and end on Em (no G)]
