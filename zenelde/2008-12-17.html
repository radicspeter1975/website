 Eb   F                           Bb
The sirens are screaming and the fires are howling
     F
Way down in the valley tonight
 Eb        F                        Am
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye
       Bb
And a blade shining oh so bright
     
         F                            C
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky
       Dm                   C     Bb
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets
        F                            C
Oh and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising
      Dm
Oh I swear I saw a young boy
 Bb/D
Down in the gutter, he was starting to foam in the heat

| C           | Bb          | C           |             ||

    Bb                             C               
Oh Baby, you're the only thing in this whole world 
        F               Bb
That's pure and good and right
                              C
And wherever you are and wherever you go
         Bb              C    F
There's always gonna be some light

       Bb
But I gotta get out
         C
I gotta break it out now
   Dm                       Bb
Before the final crack of dawn
       F                            C
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
           Bb
When it's over you know

We'll both be so alone

| C           | Bb          | C5      Bb5 |      C5  D5 ||

        F 
Like a bat out of hell
          Bb                      F
I'll be gone when the morning comes

When the night is over
       Am                      Bb5  Ab5   G
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone gone gone

        F
Like a bat out of hell 
          C                  Bb
I'll be gone when the morning comes
C5    D5    E5       F
       But when the day is done
         C
And the sun goes down
     Bb5  A5     G5 F5   G5    A5   Bb5   C5
And moonlight's shining through

             F      Am/E       Dm       F
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven
           Bb        Bb/Ab    Gm7   Bb5
I'll come crawling on back to you

     F                            Bb
I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
      F
On a silver black phantom bike
                               Am
When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry
          Bb
And we're all about to see the light

 F                          C
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole
 Dm                        Bb
Everything is stunted and lost
     F       
And nothing really rocks
     C
And nothing really rolls 
     Bb             C           F
And nothing's ever worth the cost

       Bb            C           F
And I know that I'm damned if I never get out
     Bb        C            F
And maybe I'm damned if I do
           Bb         C          Dm
But with every other beat I got left in my heart
              Bb        C           F
You know I'd rather be damned with you

      F                          C
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned
   Bb                C            F
Dancing through the night with you
                                 C
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned
 F                          Bb
Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned
      F                          C            
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned
 Bb                  C
Dancing through the night
 Bb                  C
Dancing through the night
 Bb                  C          F
Dancing through the night with you

Like a bat out of hell 
          Bb                      F
I'll be gone when the morning comes 

When the night is over 
       Am                       Bb   A    G
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone gone gone

Like a bat out of hell

I'll be gone when the morning comes

Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven 
 F       Bb         F/A     Gm7
I'll come crawling on back to you 
              F     Am/E       Dm       F
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven 
           Bb         F/A     Gm7
I'll come crawling on back to you

      Bb          Bbsus4         Bb
I can see myself tearing up the road 
           Bbsus4 Bb    C  Bb   F
Faster than any  other boy has ever gone 
G5   Ab5   A5     Bb               Bbsus4    Bb
          And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe 

No one's gonna stop me now 
                 F
I gotta make my escape 
       Eb         Bb          F
But I can't stop thinking of you 
       Ab                      Eb                    F
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late 

| F    C      |   Bb  A  Bb | F    C      |   Bb  A  Bb ||

   Ab                     Eb                    F
I never see the sudden curve till it's way too late

          Eb                       F                 Gm
Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
 Eb                      F                 Gm
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike 
       Ab                 Bb                     Cm
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell 
         Eb          F          Gm
And the last thing I see is my heart 
       Eb
Still beating 
         Gm                  Cm       Bb
Breaking out of my body and flyin away 
C                    Fsus4   F
Like a bat out of hell 

                       Ab                     Bb     Cm
Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun

Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike

And the last thing I see is my heart 
 C#sus2
Still beating 

Still beating 
         Fm                  C
Breaking out of my body and flyin away 

Like a bat out of hell 

 F    C        Bb
                Like a bat out of hell
