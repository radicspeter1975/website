D
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code envy

D                        
But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
C                              G
We don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams.
                      D
But everybody's like cristal, maybach, diamonds on your time piece.
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
C                          G
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair.

                   D
And we'll never be royals..
It don't run in our blood,
             C
That kind of lux just ain't for us.
            G
We crave a different kind of buzz.
                D
Let me be your ruler, you can call me queen bee
                C
And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule.
G
Let me live that fantasy.

D
My friends and I we've cracked the code.
We count our dollars on the train to the party.
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this,
We didn't come from money.

D                        
But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
C                              G
We don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams.

D     
Oooh ooooh ohhh
C                               G
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen.
D                    C
Oooooh ooooh ohhhhh life is game without a care
            G
We aren't caught up in your love affair.

                    D
And we'll never be royals..
