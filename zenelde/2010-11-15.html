Intro:  Am  Em \*4
  
Am                      Em            
She's a model and she's looking good
Am                          Em              
I'd like to take her home that's understood
Am                                     Em           
She plays hard to get, she smiles from time to time
Am                        Em               
It only takes a camera to change her mind

C  Bm  G   
C  Bm  E

Am                                      Em
She's going out tonight, loves drinking just champagne
Am                               Em
And she has been checking nearly all the men
Am                                 Em
She's playing her game and you can hear them say
Am                              Em
She is looking good, for beauty we will pay

C  Bm  G   
C  Bm  E

Solo:  Am  Em

Am                                 Em
She's posing for consumer products now and then
Am                             Em
For every camera she gives the best she can
Am                          Em
I saw her on the cover of a magazine
Am                                 Em
Now she's a big success, I want to meet her again

Outro:  Am  Em
