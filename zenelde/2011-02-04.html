F
You keep saying you've got something for me.
F
Something you call love, but confess.
Bb
You've been messin' where you shouldn't have been messin'
        F
and now someone else is gettin' all your best.

Chorus:
      G#                  F
These boots are made for walking,
    G#                        F
and that's just what they'll do
G#                       F     N.C.
one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over (you).

you keep lying, when you oughta be truthin'
And you keep losin' when ypu oughta not bet.
You keep samin' when you oughta be a-changin'.
Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet.

You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
and you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burnt, ha!
I just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
and what he know you ain't have time to learn.

are you ready boots? start walkin'!
