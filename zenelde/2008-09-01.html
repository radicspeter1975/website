E          A         C#m        A
You'll no longer be kissed and kind
    F#m         A
as you long for intuition,
             F#m               A       E
as have you have to learn the lesson twice.
E          A         C#m        A
You'll no longer be kissed and kind,
        F#m         A
as you long for intuition,
        F#m             A         A/F#
as you have to say the password twice.

A/F#     A/G#       E         A          A/F#
Have you ever, have you ever been all messed up,
         A/G#   E
Have you ever?

E     A F#m     A
E/G# - E  A     F#m     A

E      F#m                 C#m
You're the pincard, you're the lifeguard,
           B     E  A
you're the information guy,
      B               A               F#m             E
but things look much bigger on your knees, on your knees.
E         F#m          C#m
Miss the signal, miss the signpost,
         B       E    A
lose the access to it all.
    B         A              F#m           B(low)
and all of a sudden  you are one with the freaks.

Have you ever, have you ever been all messed up?
Have you ever?
