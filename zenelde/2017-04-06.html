G     A     G     A
        G
Smacked up again behind the door
        A
Begging please give me some more
A vein that's open for the day
Feel the pulse beneath the skin
And smiling as it all begins
Oh where have you been?

A      E              B (v. bm?)
Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's fantasy has come

   G
So amplify this little one
        A
She's a volume freak
She hears as much as she can see
And what she sees she can't believe
It's just that Judy needs a moment of release
To give her peace peace peace

A      E              B
Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's day passed out of sight
Judy will be suffering tonight
She's suffering

A      E      A      E
           G
She passed by and said good-bye to him
         A
And in a rare and lucid state
She said my days are unoriginal
I wanna fade fade fade

           A      E      B
She's suffering             (3x)

Judy's staring at the sun (she's suffering)
Judy's day passed out of sight (she's suffering)
Judy will be suffering tonight

           A           E        B   Db   D    
She's suffering, she's suffering
      Db   A           E        B   Db   D    
She's suffering, she's suffering
      Db   A           E
She's suffering, she's suffering
