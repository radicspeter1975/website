D               
I got my first real six-string
A
Bought it at the five-and-dime
D
Played 'til my fingers bled
A
It was summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a Band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far

Bm      A
Oh when I look back now
D           G
That was seemes to last forever
Bm    A
And if I had the choice
D         G
Ya - I'd always wanna be there
Bm        A
Those were the best days of my life

D – A

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive in
And that's when I met you

Standin on a mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand

I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

D   A           D – A   
(Oh yeah) Back in the summer of 69’

F       Bb
Man we were killin' time
 C
We were young and restless
   Bb
We needed to unwind
F      Bb          C            
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever no

D – AD – A

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Somethimes when I play that old six-string
I think about ya wonder what went wrong

Standin on a mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
(Oh yeah) Back in the summer of 69’
