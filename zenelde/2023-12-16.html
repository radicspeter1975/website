[Intro]
D Bm F#m G
 
[Verse 1]
  D         Bm        F#m
I broke my back 'cause
     G               D Bm F#m   G
I thought you would too
  D        Bm
I'd run in circles
   F#m           G    D Bm F#m   G
I thought you would too
 
[Pre-Chorus]
       Em
Maybe in another life
       A
Everything worked out alright
       Em                                  A
And things that made this harder passed us by
       Em
But there's no bad dream to wake up from
       A                              Em
Know I got it bad when it's the morning
                              A
And you're all that's on my mind
 
[Chorus]
      D    Bm    F#m
If I don't have you
    G                    D   Bm F#m   G
At least I'll still have me
     D    Bm    F#m
And if I don't have you
    G                    D   Bm F#m   G
At least I'll still have me
 
[Verse 2]
  D       Bm        F#m
I never thought twice
            G               D   Bm F#m   G
'Cause you were my number one
  D       Bm         F#m
I put you first 'cause
     G             D   Bm F#m   G
You were my only thought
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 Em
No more riding on the train
 A
No more smoking in the alley
 Em                           A
Now my secrets only stay with me
 Em
Everybody knows I'm upset
 A
They don't even have to ask it
 Em
They know I believed in us last week
 
[Chorus]
          D    Bm    F#m
And if I don't have you
    G                    D   Bm F#m   G
At least I'll still have me
     D    Bm    F#m
And if I don't have you
    G                    D   Bm F#m   G
At least I'll still have me
 
[Bridge]
  G                          A
There's no reason to speak badly
    Bm                F#m
We just reached our end
   G                 A
I will see you in parts of me
   Bm                 A
In who I was back then
 
[Chorus]
      D    Bm    F#m
If I don't have you
    G                    D   Bm F#m   G
At least I'll still have me
     D    Bm    F#m
And if I don't have you
    G                    D   Bm F#m   G
At least I'll still have me
 
[Outro]
D     Bm F#m G
  Me
D     Bm F#m G
  Me
