E 
The car won't start, it's falling apart, 
I was late for work and the boss got smart  
My pantyline shows, got a fun in my hose 
My hair went flat, man I hate that

E 
Just when I thought things couldn't get worse, 
I re-a-lized I forgot my purse 
With all this stress i must confess, 
this could be worse than PMS, 
 
BRIDGE: 
 
A 
This job ain't worth the pay  
Can't wait till the end of the day 
B 
Honey I'm on my way, hey!hey!hey!hey! 
 
Chorus: 
 
E 
Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day, 
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way, 
B 
rub my feet, gimme something to eat, 
Fix me up my favorite treat 
 
E 
Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me  
I need to relax and watch TV, 
B 
get off the phone give the dog a bone  
                    E 
Hey!hey! Honey, I'm home! 
 
E 
I broke a nail opening the mail 
I cursed out loud cause it hurts like hell 
This job's a pain it's so mundane 
It sure don't stimulate my brain 
 
(BRIDGE)(Chorus) 
 
E 
Oh, rub my neck will ya, E A E A 
B 
hey, hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey______! 
 
(Chorus) 
 
E
