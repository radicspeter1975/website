     Am             G         D
If I walk down this hallway tonight
         Am
It's too quiet
     G               D        Am              G
So I pad through the dark and call you on the phone
D             Am      G            D
push your old numbers and let your house ring
Am                  G       D
till I wake your ghost
 
        Am             G       D             Am
Let him walk down your hallway it's not this quiet
 
G               D        Am                G
slide down your receiver sprint across the wire
D         Am     G             D
follow my number slide into my hand
 
         Am              G         D        Am            G      D
It's the blaze across my nightgown it's the phone's ring
 
Am G D Am G D
 
Am           G     D                Am         G       D
I think last night you were driving circles around me
(X3)
 
Am                 G             D             Am
I can't drink this coffee till I put you in my closet
G                D
let him shoot me down
Am              G
let him call me off
 
  D                Am      G               D
I take it from his whisper you're not that tough
 
         Am              G         D        Am             G      D
It's the blaze across my nightgown it's the phone's ring
 
Am G D
 
Am           G     D                Am         G       D
I think last night you were driving circles around me
(X5)
 
(second voice)
Am             G       D                Am       G         D
you were in my dreams, you were driving circles around me
(X5)
