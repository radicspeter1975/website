[Intro]
B  G#  B  G#
B  G#  A  F#
 
[Verse 1]
B                    G#
Can't you hear those cavalry drums
B                  G#
Hijacking your equilibrium
B                      G#
Midnight snacks in the mausoleum
          A                   F#
Where the pixilated doctors moan
 
[Verse 2]
B                 G#
Carnivores in the Kowloon night
B                      G#
Breathing freon by the candlelight
B                         G#
Coquette bitch slap you're so polite
         A                           F#
till you thank them for the tea and sympathy
 
[Chorus]
E                  G#             G#sus4
I want to defy the logic of all sex laws
G
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
     F#            E
I'll let you be my chaperone
 
       D
At the halfway home I'm a full grown man
       A      A#
but I'm not afraid to cry
 
[Instrumental]
B  G#  B  G#
B  G#  A  F#
 
[Verse 3]
B                         G#
Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine
B                      G#
Perfumed blokes on the Ginza line
B                        G#
Running buck wild like a concubine
      A                      F#
Whose mother never held her hand
 
[Verse 4]
B                      G#
Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz
B                 G#
Wearing hepatitis contact lens
B                     G#
Bed and breakfast getaway weekends
     A                   F#
With Sports Illustrated moms
 
[Chorus]
E                  G#            G#sus4

E                  G#            G#sus4
I want to defy the logic of all sex laws
G
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
     F#            E
I'll let you be my chaperone
 
       D
At the halfway home I'm a full grown man
       A      A#
but I'm not afraid to cry
