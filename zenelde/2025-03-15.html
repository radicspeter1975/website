[Verse 1]
     Cm             Ab     Cm                Ab          Cm
Dear dar(lin') your mom my friend left a message on my machine
            Ab                  Gsus4       G
She was frantic saying you were talking crazy
     Cm            Ab               Cm
That you wanted to do away with yourself
                    Ab                 Cm
I guess she thought I'd be a perfect resort
                      Ab               Gsus4            G
'cause we've had this inexplicable connection since our youth
    Cm             Ab              Cm
And yes they're in shock, they are panicked
             Ab                     Abmaj7
You and your chronic them and their drama
            Fm                     Gsus4              G
You, this embarrassment, us in the middle of this delusion
 
[Chorus]
   Em          C          Em          C
If we were our bodies, if we were our futures
   G             D                     A
if we were our defenses I'd be joining you
   Em          C           Em          C
If we were our culture, if we were our leaders
   G              D                   A
if we were our denials I'd be joining you
 
[Verse 2]
Cm         Ab        Cm                     Ab
I remember vividly a day years ago, we were camping
                       Cm
you knew more than you thought you should know
          Ab                 Gsus4         G
You said "I don't want ever to be brainwashed"
    Cm           Ab                   Cm
and you were mindboggling, you were intense
           Ab                      Abmaj7
You were uncomfortable in your own skin
              Fm            Gsus4            G
You were thirsty but mostly you were beautiful
 
[Chorus]
   Em          C            Em            C
If we were our nametags, if we were our rejections
   G           D                        A
if we were our outcomes, I'd be joining you
   Em            C             Em             C
If we were our indignities, if we were our successes
   G             D                      A
if we were our emotions, I'd be joining you
 
[Verse 3]
Cm      Ab           Cm
You and I we're like four year olds
                Ab                     Cm
We want to know why and how come about everything
             Ab                Gsus4              G
We want to reveal ourselves at will and speak out minds
    Cm         Ab             Cm
And never talk small and be intuitive
             Ab                Cm               Ab
And question mightily and find god, my tortured beacon
           Gsus4               G
We need to find like minded companions
 
[Chorus]
   Em            C                 Em            C
If we were their condemnations, if we were their projections
   G           D                    A
if we were paranoias I'd be joining you
   Em          C           Em            C
If we were our incomes, if we were our obsessions
   G              D                       A
if we were our afflictions I'd be joining you
 
[Outro]
Cm        Ab           Cm                 Ab
We need reflection, we need a really good memory
             Cm
feel free to call me a little more often
