C                                Em
Maybe, maybe it's the clothes we wear,
                                          Fmaj7
The tasteless bracelets and the dye in our hair,
              D          G
Maybe it's our kookiness.
C                                Em    
Or maybe, maybe it's our nowhere towns,
                                     Fmaj7            
Our nothing places and our cellophane sounds,
               D          G
Maybe it's our looseness.

           C            Gm
But we're trash, you and me,
                       F
We're the litter on the breeze,
                        Fm       Adim
We're the lovers on the streets,
     C              Gm
Just trash, me and you,
                     F
It's in everything we do,
                     A\*
It's in everything we do...

C                                Em
Maybe, maybe it's the things we say,
                                     Fmaj7
The words we've heard and the music we play,
              D          G
Maybe it's our cheapness,

C                                Em
Or maybe, maybe it's the times we've had,
                                   Fmaj7
The lazy days and the crazes and the fads,
             D            G
Maybe it's our sweetness,

           C            Gm
But we're trash, you and me,
                       F
We're the litter on the breeze,
                        Fm       Adim
We're the lovers on the streets,
     C              Gm
Just trash, me and you,
                     F
It's in everything we do,
                     A\*
It's in everything we do...

     C                  Gm
But we're trash, you and me,
                          F
We're the lovers on the street,
                        Fm      E\*dim
We're the litter on the breeze,
C                   Gm
Just trash, me and you,
                      F
It's in everything we do,
                     A\*     E\*dim
It's in everything we do...
