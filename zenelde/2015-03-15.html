A        E         Bm          Bm
I wanna hold the hand inside you
A        E         Bm          Bm
i wanna take the breath's that true
A        E         Bm          Bm
i look to you and i see nothing
A        E         Bm          Bm
i look to you to see the truth
A            E               Bm        Bm
You live your life, you go in shadow
A           E                  Bm      Bm
you'll come apart and you'll go blank
A            E              Bm                Bm
some kind of night into your darkness
A           E                 Bm       Bm
colors your eyes with what's not there
A      E    Bm                D
F-----ade into you
A     E              Bm        D
S----trange you never knew
A      E    Bm                D
F-----ade into you
A           E                Bm        BM
i think it's strange you never knew
A           E             Bm          Bm
the strange light comes on slowly
A            E              Bm        Bm
a stranger's heart without a home
A            E              Bm        Bm
you put your hands into your head
A        E               Bm    Bm
and with smiles cover your heart
A       E      Bm      D
F-------ade into you
A       E       Bm     D
strange you never knew
A       E      Bm      D
f-------ade into you
A           E                Bm        Bm
i think it's strange you never knew
A       E      Bm      D
f-------ade into you
A       E       Bm     D
strange you never knew
A       E      Bm      D
f-------ade into you
A           E                Bm        Bm
i think it's strange you never knew
A           E                Bm        Bm
i think it's strange you never knew
