[Intro]
D A G
D A G
 
[Verse 1]
D     A           G
Do i look like a liar
D      A           G
Do i look like a liar to you
D                            A                 G
Fighting crime in this time brings a girl down
D        A            G
Makes a body sink so low
 
[Chorus]
            D                       A            G
And i sink pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
         D                      A             G
I sink pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
 
[Bridge]
A        G           D
I wish i carried a camera
          A                  G              D
I'd have proof that you're never where you say
A               G           D
I wish i could fly up in a helicopter
      A                G             D
I'd shine a blinding light on your escape
A          G
Better to show you
 
[Chorus]
                  D                     A            G
That i'll sink pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
            D                      A           G
I'll sink pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
 
[Verse 2]
D     A           G
Do i look like a crier
D      A              G
Do i look like a cry baby to you
D                          A               G
Fighting fire in this town wears a man out
D        A             G
Makes a body break so slow
 
[Bridge]
A                 G                D
Remember when we all went out to fire island
A                      G            D
You thought you saw a body on the beach
A               G                  D
When we got closer it was just a tire
     A              G              D
And you were disappointed i could see
A         G
So i pretended
 
[Chorus]
                  D                     A            G
And now i'm in pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
          D                     A            G
I'm in pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
D                             A                 G
Everything i ever learned is wrong so long so what
D                        A            G
Pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
 
[Interlude]
D A G
D A G
 
[Chorus]
D                        A            G
Pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
D                        A            G
Pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
D                        A            G
Pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
D
