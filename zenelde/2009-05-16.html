intro: F Bb Gm Bb F Bb Gm

Bb       F                  C            Gm
A long December and there's reason to believe
      Bb                F               Bb
Maybe this year will be better than the last
  Gm      Bb         F                   C
I can't remember the last thing that you said
            Gm
as you were leavin'
        F             Bb
Now the days go by so fast
         F               Bb         Gm    Bb
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         F                 Bb       Gm    Bb
And it's one more night in Hollywood
       F                  Bb        Gm -stop- F
If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would
  Bb   Gm  Bb ....
nanananananananana..

The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl

And it's one more day up in the conyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California...I think you should

Drove up to the Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
Makes you talk a little lower about
the things you could not show her

And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass

And it's been one more day up in the canyon
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean...I guess I should
