[Verse 1]
A                        E
I'd rather be liberated, I find myself captivated
F#m                     E
Stop doing what you. Keep doing it too.
A                                E
I'd rather stay bold and lonely, I dream I'm your one and only
F#m                  E
Stop doing what you. Keep doing it too.
 
[Chorus]
Dmaj7                           F#m
Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
C#m                      C#7
This could be a case for Mulder and Scully
Dmaj7                           F#m           G    Bm   E
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone
 
[Verse 2]
A                           E
I'd rather be jumping ship, I find myself jumping straight in
F#m                  E
Stop doing what you. Keep doing it too.
A                        E
Forever be dozy and dim, I wake myself thinking of him
F#m                  E
Stop doing what you. Keep doing it too.
 
[Chorus]
Dmaj7                           F#m
Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
C#m                      C#7
This could be a case for Mulder and Scully
Dmaj7                           F#m            C#m  C#7
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone here
 
[Bridge]
                   Dmaj7                         Dm7
My bed is made for two and there's nothing I can do
                     Am      A
So tell me something I don't know
                      Dmaj7                      Dm7
If my head is full of you is there nothing I can do?
                     F      Am     E
Must we all march in two by two by two?
 
[Verse 3]
A                             E
And as for some happy ending, I'd rather stay single and thin
F#m                  E
Stop doing what you. Keep doing it to me
 
[Chorus]
Dmaj7                           F#m
Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
C#m                      C#7
This could be a case for Mulder and Scully
Dmaj7                           F#m            C#m  C#7
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone here
Dmaj7                           F#m
Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
C#m                      C#7
This could be a case for Mulder and Scully
Dmaj7                           F#m           G
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone
 
[Outro]
                        E
So what have you got to say about that?
                      E
And what does someone do without love?
                      E
And what does someone do with love?
                         E
And what have you got to say about that?
