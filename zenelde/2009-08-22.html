<pre>
I it's possible I
Have gone too far
When it comes to you

I can't wait for the day
When all the bad things I deserve
come crashing in and all I do is love you

Time, it's possible time
Could be my soldier and my king
In a war for you

And words, could bring you down
And put your heart right at my hands,
where I wanted to.

Then, when everything's changed
When all's forgotten foolery
And you are mine entirely and

Stars could guide our way
No matter how far away
Deep down or gone astray
God knows I'm lost
and all I do is love you

Say now, say now, could it be
When it comes to you and me
What is left for me to do
Now it's all just up to you
Maybe that was all your plan
And I'm just part of something else
So what is left for me to do
Now that's all just up to you
