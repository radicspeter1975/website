Félhanggal mélyebben: E=Eb

Intro:  E   A   F#m A   E

           E                   A
There's a song playing on the radio
F#m              A                       E
Sky high in the airwaves on the morning show
And there's a lifeline slipping as the record plays
And as I open the blinds in my mind I'm believing that you could stay

     A         B                   A                B
And oh if you stay I'll chase the rainblown fields away
        A                                    B
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
          C#m     F#
Oh if you stay
                   A                            E
We'll be the wild ones, running with the dogs today

There's a song playing through another wall
All we see and believe is the DJ and debts dissolve
And it's a shame the plane is leaving on this sunny day
Cause of you my tattoo will be bleeding and the name will stain

But oh, if you stay we'll ride through disguised suburban graves
We'll go from the bungalows where the debts still grow each day

And oh if you stay I'll chase the rainblown fears away
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun oh if you stay
We'll be the wild ones running with the dogs today
We'll be the wild ones running with the dogs today
