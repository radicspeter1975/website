<i>It was on a divine visitation that the Lord told me that I was to go on to television 
I was laying on the bed and the bed began to go around 
And I had this sensation like I was on a miracle round 
And then the furniture joined in and then I was in the stars 
There were stars everywhere 
Above me, below me, to the left of me, to the right of me – millions and millions of stars 
And the Lord said: The stars are the souls that you’ll win for me 
The Lord actually talks to me, you know, I hear what’s beg he said 
And he said to me: Give me 18 million dollars by the weekend 
And the Angel of the Lord stands by my side and speaks into my ear 
It’s a beautiful thing and I hear what’s being said 
It’s a marvellous, marvellous experience, I never thought that such a thing could happen 
In the name of Jesus!

And the Lord spoke to me 
He said: stretch forth your hand 
Tell the people to put their hands against yours and I will heal them 
Get me 18 million dollars by the weekend 
Touch the screen! Touch the screen!</i> 

You see the face on the TV screen, coming at you every Sunday 
See that face on the billboard, that man is me 
On the cover of the magazine, there's no question why I'm smiling 
You buy a piece of paradise, you buy a piece of me 
I'll get you everything you wanted, I’ll get you everything you need 
Don't need to believe in hereafter, just believe in me 

(Refrain) 
Cos Jesus he knows me, and he knows I’m right 
I've been talking to Jesus all my life 
Oh yes he knows me, and he knows I’m right 
And he's been telling me everything is alright 

I believe in the family, with my ever loving wife beside me 
But she don't know about my girlfriend, or the man I met last night 
Do you believe in God, cos that is it what I'm selling 
And if you wanna get to heaven, all I see you right 
You won't even have to leave your house, or get outta your chair 
You don't even have to touch that dial, cos I'm everywhere 

(Refrain) 

<i>God save the way he just uses me as his instrument 
He speaks his power through my voice 
In the sign of the cross, Jesus told me that</i>

Won't find me practising what I'm preaching, won't find me making no sacrifice 
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles, if you promise to be good, try to be nice 
God will take good care of you, just do as I say, don't do as I do 

I'm counting my blessings, I've found true happiness 
Cos I'm getting richer, day by day 
You can find me in the phone book, just call my toll free number 
You can do it anyway you want, just do it right away 
There'll be no doubt in your mind, you'll believe everything I'm saying 
If you wanna get closer to him, get on your knees and start paying 

(Refrain 2x) 

<i>One day I was standing before the cameras right here in the cathedral 
When the Lord spoke to me 
He said: Stretch forth your hand and tell the people to put their hands against yours and I will heal them 
He said this is a form of laying-on-hands 
So put your hands on the screens now 
Touch the screen! Touch the screen! Heal! Heal! Heal! 
In the name of Jesus! Heal! Touch the screen! 
Touch…</i>
