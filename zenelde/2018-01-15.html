[Verse]
A           E
Lying in my bed again,
      F#m                  D
And I cry cause you're not here.
A            E
Crying in my head again,
      F#m                D
And I know that it's not clear.
         A
Put your hands, put your hands
          E        F#m                D
Inside my face and see that it's just you.
         A
But it's bad, and it's mad,
         E
And it's making me sad
        F#m             D
Because I can't be with you

[Chorus]
            A            E            F#m          D
    Be with you, Be with you, Be with you, Be with you,
            A            E
    Be with you, Be with you,
         F#m             D
    Babe I can't be with you.

[Verse]
Thinking back on how things were
And how we loved so well
I wanted to be the mother
of your child
And now it's just farewell

Put your hands inside my hands
And come with me,
We'll find another end
And my head, and my head
On anyone's shoulder
Cause I can't be with you.

[Chorus]

Cause you're not here, you're not here
Baby I can't be with you
Cause you're not here, you're not here
And back I'm still in love with you.
