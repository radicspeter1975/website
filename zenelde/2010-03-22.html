Intro: C    Fm   Am   F   Fm
C     
should never have left the crystal lake
D
the parties full of folks who flake 
Dm
Italian leather winter games 
F              Fm
Retired by the duraflames

C
The crystal lake it only laughs
D
It knows you're just a modern man 
Dm
It's shining like the chandelier 
F                 Fm            Bb
Shining somewhere far away from here 

CHORUS:
Bb                    Ab 
I've gotta get out of here   (X3)
Bb                    Ab     F    G~
I've gotta get out of here

(string-picked)
G        F  Eb  D   C
And find my way again
G         F  Eb  D   C
I've lost my way again

C    Fm   Am   F   Fm

(the following is the same chords)
VERSE
Should never have left the crystal lake 
For areas where trees are fake 
And dogs are dead with broken hearts 
Collapsing by the coffee carts 

The crystal lake it only laughs 
It knows you're just a modern man 
It's shining like the chandelier 
Shining somewhere far away from here 

CHORUS
I've gotta get outta here 
I've gotta get outta here 
I've gotta get outta here 
I've gotta get outta here...

And find my way again 
I've lost my way again

C   Fm (x4)

end on C
