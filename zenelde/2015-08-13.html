Intro - E   F#m   A   E

E                          F#m
Put your hands on the wheel
        A          E    F#m   A
Let the golden age begin
E                  F#m
Let the window down
         A                 E   F#m   A
Feel the moonlight on your skin
E                  F#m
Let the desert wind
A                E   F#m   A
Cool your aching head
E                          F#m
let the weight of the world
A            E    F#m   A
Drift away instead

D   A   F#m        A            E   F#m
Oh      These days I barely get by
A            E   F#m   A
I don't even try

E                      F#m
It's a treacherous road
A                E   F#m   A
With a desolated view
E                     F#m
There's distant lights
A                        E   F#m   A
But here they're far and few
E                      F#m
And the sun don't shine
A              E   F#m   A
Even when it's day
E                        F#m
You gotta drive all night
A                        E   F#m   A
Just to feel like you're OK

D   A   F#m        A            E   F#m
Oh      These days I barely get by
A            E   F#m
I don't even try
A            E   F#m   A
I don't even try

E   F#m   A   E
