[Intro]
| E    | E    | E    | E    |
| E    | E    | A    | A    |
 
| E    | E    | A    | A    |
| E    | E    | A    | A    |
 
[Verse 1]
E                                 A
Nighttime slows, raindrops splash rainbows
        Asus2   E                          A      Asus2
Perhaps someone you know could sparkle and shine
       E                             A
As the daydreams slide to color from shadow
            E                         A     Asus2  A
Picture the moon glow that dazzles my eyes
    B      A
And I love you
 
[Chorus]
E                          A                                F#m
Just lying, smiling in the dark, shooting stars around your heart
                             B                           E
Dreams come bouncing in your head, pure and simple every time
                          A                                    F#m
Now you 're crying in your sleep, I wish you'd never learned to weep
                                    B                             E
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping pure and simple every time

[Verse 2]
E                                   A
Dream of sights, of sleigh rides in seasons
         Asus2  E                           A     Asus2
Where feelings, not reasons, can make you decide
   E                                  A
As leaves pour down, splash autumn on gardens
                 E                      A        Asus2
As colder nights harden their moonlit delights
    B      A
And I love you
 
[Chorus]
E                          A                                F#m
Just lying, smiling in the dark, shooting stars around your heart
                             B                           E
Dreams come bouncing in your head, pure and simple every time
                          A                                    F#m
Now you're crying in your sleep, I wish you'd never learned to weep
                                    B                             E
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping pure and simple every time
 
                       A                          F#m
Look at me with starry eyes, push me up to starry skies
                   B                           E
The stardust in my head, pure and simple every time
                         A                           F#m
Fresh and deep as oceans new, shiver at the sight of you
                   B                          E
I'll sing a softer tune, pure and simple over you
 
[Solo]
|(E)   | E    | A    | B    |
| E    | E    | A    | B    |
 
[Bridge]
   E
If love's the truth then look no lies and let me swim around your eyes
     A                                 B
I've found the place I'll never leave, shut my mouth and just believe
     E
Love is the truth I've realized, not a stream of pretty lies
A                  B          E
 To use us up, and waste our time
 
[Chorus]
(E)                        A                                F#m
Just lying, smiling in the dark, shooting stars around your heart
                             B                           E
Dreams come bouncing in your head, pure and simple every time
                          A                                    F#m
Now you're crying in your sleep, I wish you'd never learned to weep
                                    B                             E
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping pure and simple every time
 
                       A                          F#m
Look at me with starry eyes, push me up to starry skies
                   B                            E
The stardust in my head, pure and simple every time
                         A                           F#m
Fresh and deep as oceans new, shiver at the sight of you
                   B                          A
I'll sing a softer tune, pure and simple over you
 B                       E
Pure and simple just for you
