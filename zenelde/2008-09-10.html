Mama they try and break me

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone

They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?

Mama they try and break me
Still they try and break me

'Scuse me while I tend to how to feel
These things return to me that still seem real

Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For you,can't hold off fear
No not on me
So please excuse me
While I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That everlast the night
So build a wall
Behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Can't you hear your name?

Did you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That everlast the night
So build a wall
Behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Mama they try and break me
Mama they try
