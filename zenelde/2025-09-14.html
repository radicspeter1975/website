[Verse]
G
Any man of mine better be proud of me
D                     G
Even when I'm ugly he still better love me
 
And I can be late for a date that's fine
       D              G
But he better be on time
 
Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
     D                           G
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
 
And anything I do or say better be okay
       D                  G
When I have a bad hair day
 
[Pre-chorus]
C                      G
And if I change my mind a million times
C                     D
I wanna hear him say: Yeah, yeah, yeah I like that way!
 
[Chorus]
           C                    G
Any man of mine better walk the line
                 D                                G      G7
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
                 C                    G
I need a man who knows how the story goes
                F
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
C                         D
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
               G
Any man of mine

[Verse]
     G
Well any man of mine better disagree
       D                           G
When I say another woman's lookin' better than me
 
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
            D                         G
He better say: Mmm, I like it like that
 
[Pre-chorus]
C                      G
And if I change my mind a million times
C                     D
I wanna hear him say: Yeah, yeah, yeah I like that way!
 
[Chorus]
           C                    G
Any man of mine better walk the line
                 D                                G      G7
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
                 C                    G
I need a man who knows how the story goes
                F
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
C                         D
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
               C     G  C
Any man of mine
 
[Bridge]
C                    D
Let me hear him say: Yeah, yeah, yeah I like that way!
G                               A
  Any man - any man - any maaaan
 
[Chorus]
           D                    A
Any man of mine better walk the line
                 E                                A     A7
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
                 D                    A
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
                G
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
D                         E
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
               A
Any man of mine
