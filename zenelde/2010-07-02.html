A                            C#m
London never sleeps, it just sucks
    Bm
The life out of me
        E
And the money from my pocket
A                             C#m
London always creeps, showbiz hugs
    Bm
The life out of me
          E
Have some dignity honey

B                  G#m
Euston, Paddington train station please
         C#m
Make the red lights turn green
F#
Endlessly
   B                           G#m
My black cab rolls through the neon disease
C#m        F#
Endlessly, endlessly

London never sleeps, it sucks
The life out of me
Show some dignity honey
Sushi bars, wet fish it just sucks
The life out of me
And the money from my pocket

Euston, Paddington train station please
Make the red lights turn green
Endlessly
My black cab rolls through the neon disease
Endlessly, endlessly

       A                 C#m
I come alive outside the M25
                         G
I won't drink the poison Thames
                       Bb
I'll chase the sun out West

C#                  Bbm
Euston, Paddington train station please
         ebm
Make the red lights turn green
G#
Endlessly

C#                             Bbm
My black cab rolls through the neon disease
ebm         G#
Endlessly, endlessly

C#
I come alive
I come alive
