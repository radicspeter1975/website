[Intro]
G         D        Em       C7
G         D        Em       C7
 
[Verse 1]
G       D         Em       C7
Lookin around the house, 
G      D          Em             C7
Hidden behind the window and the door
G            D        Em               C7
Searchin for signs of life but there's nobody home
 
[Interlude]
G         D        Em       C7
G         D        Em       C7
 
[Verse 2]
     G        D       Em        C7
Now maybe I'm just too sure
     G         D          Em              C7
Or maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it
G           D          Em            C7
Pieces of notes fall down but the letter said
 
[Chorus 1]
G       D           Em    C7
Uh-huh,     it was good living with you 
G       D           Em     C7
Uh-huh,     it was good, Uh-huh
 
G       D           Em    C7
Uh-huh,     it was good living with you 
G       D           Em     C7
Uh-huh,     it was good, Uh-huh
 
[Interlude]
G     D     Em    C7     G    D   Em   C7
Good, Good, Good, Good, Good, Good
 
[Verse 3]
G       D      Em    C7
Sitting around the house, 
G          D          Em             C7
Watching the sun trace shadows on the floor
G              D       Em                     C7
Searchin for signs of life but there's nobody home
 
[Interlude]
G         D        Em       C7
 
[Verse 4]
       G          D      Em           C7
Well maybe I'll call or write you a letter
       G         D         Em      C7
Now maybe we'll see on the 4th of July
         G       D            Em        C7
But I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud
           G       D           Em        C7
Well, I'm not too sure and I'm not too proud to say
 
[Chorus 2]
G       D           Em    C7
Uh-huh,     it was good living with you 
G       D           Em     C7
Uh-huh,     it was good, Uh-huh
 
G       D           Em    C7
Uh-huh,     it was good living with you 
G       D           Em     C7
Uh-huh,     it was good, Uh-huh

G       D           Em    C7

G       D           Em     C7
Uh-huh,     it was good, Uh-huh
 
G       D           Em    C7
