   Verse 2
             Em        D           A               C
   You are a raging sea, I pull myself out everyday 
              Em    D                A                   C
   I plea insanity, 'cause I can't leave and I can't stay

   Now you don't bring me anything but down
   Em              F                 Am
   everything is crashing to the ground
   Em               C#m7b5
   Maybe I'm not your perfect kind
   C
   Maybe I'm not what you had in mind 
   Em         C#m7b5               C
   And maybe we're just killing time

   Verse 3
                Em          D           A                 C
   You with your silky words, and your eyes of green and blue
                  Em          D               A                 C
   You with your steel beliefs that don't match anything you do

   You were so much easier before you became you.

   Now you don't bring me anything but down

   When you come around.
                        G   F   Am
   When you come around ..

  Outro
   G                     D
   Well no more playing seek and hide, 
   Am                C 
   No more long and wasted nights,
   G                 D            Am   
   Can't you make it easy on yourself.
        G                 D
   Well I know you wish you were strong,
   Am                 C
   You wish you were never wrong, 
        G           F             Am 
   Well I got some wishes of my own.
