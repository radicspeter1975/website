[Intro]
Am
 
[Verse 1]
Am
When I was just a little boy
                               Em
I asked my father, what will I be
Will I be handsome, will I be rich
                       Am
Here's what he said to me
 
[Chorus]
      Dm
Que sera, sera
              Am
Whatever will be, will be
                 Em
The future's not ours to see
            Am  Em
Que sera, sera
                   Am
What will be, will be
 
[Verse 2]
Am
Now I have children of my own
                                   Em
They ask their father, what will I be
Will I be pretty, will I be rich
                  Am
I tell them tenderly
 
[Chorus]
      Dm
Que sera, sera
              Am
Whatever will be, will be
                 Em
The future's not ours to see
            Am  Em
Que sera, sera
                   Am
What will be, will be
 
[Outro]
Am Em
