E                     
Last time I was sober
                D  E
Man, I felt bad        
E
Worst hangover that I ever had
D    E            
Took six hamburgers
                     D
and scotch all night
E
nicotine for breakfast 

just to put me right

          C
Cos if you wanna run cool
       D
If you wanna run cool
       C               D
If you wanna run cool, you got to run
E
On heavy, heavy fuel
C         D            E
On heavy, heavy fuel

My life makes perfect sense
Lust and food and violence
Sex and money are my major kicks
Get me in a fight I like dirty tricks

CHORUS

My chick loves a man whos strong
The things shell do to turn me on
I love the babes, dont get we wrong
Hey, thats why I wrote this song

CHORUS

I dont care if my liver is hanging by a thread
Dont care if my doctor says I ought to be dead
When my ugly big car wont climb this hill
Ill write a suicide note on a hundred dollar bill

       C
Cos if you wanna run cool
       D
If you wanna run cool
       C               D
If you wanna run cool, you got to run
E
On heavy, heavy fuel
C         D            E
On heavy, heavy fuel
C         D            E
On heavy, heavy fuel
