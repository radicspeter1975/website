<pre>
A               F#                        G                         A  (C-B-Bb)
I feel real now walking like a woman and talking like a stone age man
A               F#                       F            A
I feel real now talking like buddha and doing it again
A             F#                   G                        A
I get kick I rip it up kick it up take it like a teenage tough
A                F#                      F                  A
I feel real now talking like sugar and shaking that stuff
        C  B            Bb    A   (C-A)
Singing I      can't get enough
        C  B            Bb    A
Singing I      can't get enough
