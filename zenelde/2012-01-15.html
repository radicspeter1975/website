F#5
The sun comes up another day begins
           B5
And I don't even worry about the state I'm in
F#5
Head so heavy and I'm looking thin
            B5
But when the sun goes down I wanna start again

Don't turn around until you look at me
       B5
Why don't you take a second and tell me what you see
F#5
Things I see you only disagree

F#5
Thinking of love but I can't hear what you're saying
  B5
Tomorrow I'm leaving  
F#5

Cause I'm not understanding you
