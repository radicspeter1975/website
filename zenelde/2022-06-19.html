Vers 1: (slowly)
Em B7 Em    G                 B
To Bombay a travelling circus came,
    F#7                     B            F#7            B
they brought an intelligent elephant and Nellie was her name.
 
Em  B7   Em    G                    B
One dark night she slipped her iron chain
    F#7            B                 F#7        B
and off she ran to Hindustan and was never seen again...
 
(music stops)
 
Ooooooooooooooooh....
 
Chorus: (faster)
E                                        A                    E
Nellie the elephant packed her trunk and said good-bye to the circus
A                  E                A      F#7    B
Off she went with a trumpety-trump, TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
    E                                        A                    E
Now Nellie the elephant packed her trunk and trumbled back to the jungle
A                   E               F#7    B7     E
Off she went with a trumpety-trump. TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
 
 
Vers 2: (slowly)
Em    B7 Em         G                    B
Night by night, she danced to the circus band,
     F#7                    B              F#7                 B
when Nellie was leading the big parade she looked so proud and grand
 
Em B7   Em         G            B
No more tricks for Nellie to perform
     F#7               B                  F#7               B
they taught her how to take a bow and she took the crowd by storm...
 
(music stops)
 
Ooooooooooooooooh
 
Chorus: (faster)
E                                        A                    E
Nellie the elephant packed her trunk and said good-bye to the circus
A                  E                A      F#7    B
Off she went with a trumpety-trump, TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
    E                                        A                    E
Now Nellie the elephant packed her trunk and trumbled back to the jungle
A                   E               F#7    B7     E
Off she went with a trumpety-trump. TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!

they met one night in the silver light on the road to Mandalay...
