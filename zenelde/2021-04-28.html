[Intro]
A F#m Bm E
 
[Verse]
A                         F#m
Take away the sensation inside
Bm                         E
bittersweet migraine in my head
     A                                 F#m
It's like a throbbing toothache of the mind
Bm                            E
I can't take this feeling any more
 
[Chorus]
 
D5                                      A5
   Drain the pressure from the swelling
D5                               A5
   this sensation's overwhelming
   D5
   Give me a long kiss goodnight
       F#5
   and everything will be alright
   B5                          E5
   Tell me that I won't feel a thing
                A      F#m    Bm    E
   Give me novacaine
 
[Verse]
A                         F#m
Out of body and out of mind
Bm                        E
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
     A                                 F#m
I get the funny feeling and that's alright
Bm                            E
Jimmy says it's better than here

 
[Chorus]
 
D5                                      A5
   Drain the pressure from the swelling
D5                               A5
   this sensation's overwhelming
   D5
   Give me a long kiss goodnight
       F#5
   and everything will be alright
   B5                          E5
   Tell me that I won't feel a thing
                A5
   Give me novacaine
 
   Oh novacaine
