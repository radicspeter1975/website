[Verse 1]
Bm    A      E                      Bm
You call to me, and I fall at your feet
             A             E
How could anyone ask for more
Bm        A    E                        Bm
And our time apart, like knives in my heart
             A            E
How could anyone ask for more
 
[Chorus]
         Em                   D/F#
But if there's a pill to help me forget,
      G               A
God knows I haven't found it yet
          Em                G
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to
                          D                 A
Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far
                  Bm                    G
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
                        D                            A
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
                     Bm                           G
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
                      Em          G
Cause trying not to love you
                        Bm    A    E
Only makes me love you more
                        Bm    A    E
Only makes me love you more
 
[Verse 2]
Bm         A      E                      Bm
And this kind of pain, only time takes away
                  A                E
That's why it's harder to let you go
Bm          A      E                      Bm
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you
                  A                E
That's why it's harder to let you go
 
[Chorus]
         Em                   D/F#
But if there's a pill to help me forget,
      G               A
God knows I haven't found it yet
          Em                G
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to
                          D                 A
Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far
                  Bm                    G
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
                        D                            A
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
                     Bm                           G
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
                      Em          G
Cause trying not to love you
                        D
Only makes me love you more
 
[Bridge]
                 A                       Em
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself
                         G
Was it something that I did
                    D
Was there somebody else
                         A                            Em
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears
                      G                              Em
Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear
                    G
Tonight I'm dying to tell you

[Outtro]
                       D                   A
That trying not to love you, only went so far
                Bm                       G
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart
                       D                               A
Now I see the silver lining, from what we're fighting for
                         Bm                       G
And if we just keep on trying, we could be much more
                       Em      G
Cause trying not to love you
                           Em      G
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you
                        Bm    A    E
Only makes me love you more
                        Bm    A    E
Only makes me love you more
