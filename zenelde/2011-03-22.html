Intro:
C G Fmaj7 G Fmaj7 C D G (X2)

C                 G 
Think of you with pipe and slippers
Fmaj7           G 
Think of her in bed
Fmaj7             C                   D           G 
Laying there just watching telly then think of me instead
     C             G               Fmaj7            G 
I'll never grow so old and flabby, that could never be
Fmaj7       G         C 
Don't marry her, have me

     C                      G 
Your love light shines like cardboard
         Fmaj7          G 
But your work shoes are glistening
        Fmaj7     C 
She's a PHD in 'I told you so'
         D                      G 
You've a knighthood in 'I'm not listening'
       C                G            Fmaj7            G 
She'll grab your Sandra Bullocks and slowly raise the knee
Fmaj7       G         C 
Don't marry her, have me

        C                                 Fmaj7 C 
And the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco Bay
        Fmaj7                     C 
And you realise you can't make it anyway
                                   Fmaj7          C 
You have to wash the car, take the kiddies to the park,
Fmaj7       G         C 
Don't marry her, have me

      C             G 
Those lovely Sunday mornings
     Fmaj7                G 
With breakfast brought in bed
      Fmaj7                C                D                   G 
Those blackbirds look like knitting needles trying to peck your head
      C                    G            Fmaj7          G 
Those birds will peck your soul out and throw away the key
Fmaj7       G         C 
Don't marry her, have me

        C                G 
And the kitchen's always tidy
    Fmaj7             G 
The bathroom's always clean
Fmaj7                    C                        D             G 
She's a diploma in 'just hiding things', you've a first in 'low esteem'
          C              G                Fmaj7          G 
When your socks smell of angels, but your life smells of Brie
Fmaj7       G         C 
Don't marry her, have me

        C                                 Fmaj7 C 
And the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco Bay
        Fmaj7                     C 
And you realise you can't make it anyway
                                   Fmaj7          C 
You have to wash the car, take the kiddies to the park,
Fmaj7       G         C 
Don't marry her, have me

        C                                 Fmaj7 C 
And the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco Bay
        Fmaj7                     C 
And you realise you can't make it anyway
                                   Fmaj7          C 
You have to wash the car, take the kiddies to the park,
Fmaj7       G         C 
Don't marry her, have me
