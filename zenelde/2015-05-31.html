<i>Everybody be cool, this is a robbery
Any of you fucking pricks move
And I'll execute every motherfucking last one of you</i>

D A C G 

Me and Fast got the gats, we're out to rob a bank 
We got Steve outside carrying a full pack 
Now everything's cool and everything's smooth (Hey that's smooth)

I walked up to the teller, I gave her the letter 
She gives me the loot with puckered up lips and a wink 
That I found cute and I said, "Baby, baby, baby" 
(Is this some kharmic-chi love thing happening here baby or what?)

D fm em
By that time Fast tapped me with the 9 
He said it was time to blow, ya know 
So out the door we go back to the ride with Steve inside 
And alive and off we drive

See, I hurt my lower lumbar, you know we'll never get far 
Riding around in a stolen police car So we dropped it off and piled in a Caddy 
Steve was driving because I had to talk to my man about something

<i>Look, I don't know anything about any fucking set-up 
You can torture me all you want 
Torture you, that's good, that's a good idea, I like that one</i>

Running around robbing banks All wacked off of Scooby Snacks

And I don't give a fuck about the hell's gate 
Ain't punkin' the crowd and I'm still standing up straight 
So, we pull these jobs to make a little money 
No one gets hurt if they don't act funny

On the way to the yacht, we almost got caught 
Fast is shooting mailboxes, not knowing where the cop is, yeah 
They're at the Dunkin Donuts, adjacent from the Froman's Whose mailbox fast had just exploded
They gave chase, but my man Steve is an ace And we lost those brothers with haste 
We casted off and along we went Off Bermuda to an island resort we rented

<i>Sonny, I need you cool, are you cool? ... I am cool</i>
