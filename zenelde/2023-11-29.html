C          F
The sun is out
C              F
The clouds are slowly going
C   C/B    Am       C       D G
And now my heart is growing fast
C            F
So let's get up
C           F
Put on your hat and clothing
C     C/B    Am       C        D   G
Let's take a trip and lose our minds
 
CHORUS:
 
C        Em                  C7     Am
Let's go walking through the park today
G#     C      Am      Dm  G
I love sunday mondays any day
C        Em                 C7       Am
When the skies are blue and it's not grey
G#        C      Am      Dm  G     C
I'll take sunday mondays any every day
 
II:
 
C              F
Sometimes it's fun
C         F
To just escape and run
C   C/B        Am       C     D    G
And leave this troubled world behind
C            F
So let's get lost
C           F
And get our juices flowing
C   C/B      Am       C      D  G
And let's go see what we can find
 
CHORUS(x2):
 
C        Em                  C7     Am
Let's go walking through the park today
G#     C      Am      Dm  G
I love sunday mondays any day
C        Em                 C7       Am
When the skies are blue and it's not grey
G#        C      Am      Dm  G     C
I'll take sunday mondays any every day
