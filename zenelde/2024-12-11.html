[Verse 1]
     Em     G C          Asus2
Some-times, I feel, I've got to;
Em G     C         Asus2
   Run a-way, I've got to;
Em G     C
   Get A-way,
         Asus2       Em       G      C        Asus2
From the pain you drive in-to the heart of me.
 
    Em   G  C     Asus2
The love we share, seems to,
Em  G     C
    Go no-where.
G         Em   G  C    Asus2
 And I've lost my light,
      Em                     G
For I toss and turn; I can't sleep at night.
 
[Chorus]
E                  G
 Once I ran to you, now I run from you,
C
 This tainted love you've given,
  Am
I give you all a boy could give you.
Asus2
 Take my tears and that's not nearly...
Em   G        C     Asus2
 All, Tainted love, oh, oh, oh,
Em  G       C    Asus2
    Tainted love.
 
[Verse 2]
 
Em   G C          Asus2
 Now I know, I've got to;
Em G     C         Asus2
   Run a-way, I've got to;
Em G     C
   Get A-way.
    Asus2     Em              G
You don't really want any more from me.
 
   Em   G      C
To make things right,
    Asus2         Em     G        C
You need some-one to hold you tight.
Asus2        Em         G     C
 And you think love is to pray,
Asus2        Em             G
 But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way.
 
[Chorus]
E                  G
 Once I ran to you, now I run from you,
C
 This tainted love you've given,
  Am
I give you all a boy could give you.
Asus2
 Take my tears and that's not nearly...
Em   G        C     Asus2
 All, Tainted love, oh, oh, oh,
Em  G       C    Asus2
    Tainted love.
 
[Verse 3]
      Em    G   C
Don't touch me, please,
  Asus2       Em        G       C
I can not stand the way you tease.
  Em                   G       C
I love you, though you hurt me so,
Asus2        Em               G
 Now I'm going to pack my things and go.
 
[Coda]
Em  G        C     Asus2
     Tainted love, oh, oh, oh,
Em  G        C     Asus2
     Tainted love, oh, oh, oh.
Em  G        C     Asus2
     Tainted love, oh, oh, oh,
Em  G        C     Asus2
     Tainted love, oh, oh, oh.
 
Em  G               C       Asus2
    Touch me, baby, tainted love,
Em  G               C       Asus2
    Touch me, baby, tainted love.
 
Em  G        C     Asus2
     Tainted love, oh, oh, oh,
Em  G        C     Asus2
     Tainted love, oh, oh, oh.
