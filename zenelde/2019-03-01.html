[intro]

G        D            Em       C
I took a walk in the rain one day
         G         D       C     C
On the wrong side of the tracks
    G           D            Em        C
I stood on the rails till I saw that train
         G           D            C   C
Just to see how my heart would react
     Em          Bm             C             C
Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate
          Em        D        C   C
And for them I can not disagree
      G              D             Em        C
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
       G           G/B       C    C
I say fate should not tempt me

   (C)       G    D   C    C          G          D      C   C
I take my chances;      I don't mind working without a net
   (C)       G    D   C    C        G           D         C   C
I take my chances;      I take my chances every chance I get

I sat alone in the dark one night, tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light but there was brimstone in his throat
He'd show me the way according to him in return for my personal check
I flipped the channel back to CNN, and I lit another cigarette

I take my chances; yes, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances; I take my chances every chance I get

G  D  C  C    G  D  C  C    G  D  C  C    G  D  C  C
[guitar solo]

I've crossed lines of words and wire, and both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out and I've been on fire, and the tears are mine to weep
But I can cry until I laugh, or laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half, I'll play from either side

I take my chances; I pay my dollar and I place my bet
I take my chances; I take my chances every chance I get
I take my chances; yeah, I don't cling to remorse or regret
I take my chances; I take my chances every chance I get
I take my chances...

[Repeat G D C C; end on G.]

[Concert ad-lib lyrics:]
  No remorse, no regrets
  I chewed another Nicorette
  I ordered up some crepes Suzette
  I found Elvis on the Internet
  I went camping with a young cadet
  He showed me his bayonet
  I looked at him and said, "you should get an Erector set"
  Who needs a boyfriend, you can get a pet

TAB:
The electric guitar actually plays this in C with no capo.  These are the
right notes; I'm not sure about the exact fingerings.

  C       G        F                C       G        F
E ----0-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
B --1-----3-----1-|------1---------|----1---0-------|----------------|
G 0---------4-----|--2-------0---0-|--0-------0---2-|------0---------|
D ------------5---|----3-------3---|2-----------0---|--3-------3---3-|
A ----------------|----------------|----------------|----3-------3---|
E ----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
  ^ . ^ . ^ . ^ .  ^ . ^ . ^ . ^ .  ^ . ^ . ^ . ^ .  ^ . ^ . ^ . ^ .

Here it is in G, if you want to play it with the capo on the 5th fret:

  G       D        C                G       D        C
E ----7---5-----3-|------3---------|----3---2-----0-|----------------|
