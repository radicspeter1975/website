E  B  A             B
she   colourblind   tired eyes
E    B A       B
 her   hallway   aching
E             B        A               B
 she'll never move him - likes it that way
E           B                A    B              E

     A               B
it's not too soon at all
E              B               A

A    B              E
mmm-wah, why do you stare so hard
B                 A           B                 E    B A
wrapped up like a doll in bad dreams and broken arms
            B
make these old bones shiver

E             B
 it's not too soon he said
     A               B
it's not too soon at all
E              B               A

E               B
  the last time i saw you,
         A               B
you were standing in the dark
E            B
  and with a freezing face,
  A                 B
i watched you fall apart

 or E B A B - [2x]

if you're afraid to fall - i said

        E
        done your time

        been in your place
          B
        i couldn't look you in the face
            A
        and tell you that it turns me on
           B
        it makes my stomach turn

  E
i know
       B A B
i know her

 or E B A B - [5x]
