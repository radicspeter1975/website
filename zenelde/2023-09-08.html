fél hanggal magasabban (am=bbm)

[Intro]
Am – F (2x)
 
[Verse 1]
 
Am
Coming up beyond belief
                   F
On this coronary thief
Ba dum pum pum pa da da dum (2x) (or something like that)
 
Am
More than just a leitmotif
                        F
More chaotic, no relief
Ba dum pum pum pa da da dum (2x)
 
(etc)
I'll describe the way I feel
Weeping wounds that never heal
Ba dum pum pum pa da da dum (2x)
 
Can the savior be for real
Or are you just my seventh seal?
Ba dum pum pum pa da da dum (2x)
  
[Pre-Chorus]
C                  Dsus2 (or D, whatever sounds better for you)
No hesitation, no delay
             F                  C
You come on just like special K
                                Dsus2
Just like I swallowed half my stash
          F
I never ever want to crash
 
(etc)
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand
 
[Chorus]
C
Gravity
             Am
No escaping..... gravity
C
Gravity
             Am
No escaping..... not for free
      F
I fall down... hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
                                  Am
Every time you seem to come around
 
[Verse 2]
 
I'll describe the way I feel
You're my new Achilles heel
Ba dum pum pum pa da da dum (2x)
 
Can this savior be for real
Or are you just my seventh seal?
Ba dum pum pum pa da da dum (2x)
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C                  Dsus2 (or D, whatever sounds better for you)
No hesitation, no delay
             F                  C
You come on just like special K
                                Dsus2
Just like I swallowed half my stash
          F
I never ever want to crash
 
(etc)
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand
 
[Chorus] (Instead of Am play C at the end of the chorus)
C
Gravity
             Am
No escaping..... gravity
C
Gravity
             Am
No escaping..... not for free
      F
I fall down... hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
                                  C
Every time you seem to come around
                Am
No escaping gravity
                C
No escaping gravity
                Am
No escaping gravity
No escaping
 F
Gravity (x4)
 
C
