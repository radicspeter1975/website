[Intro]
A G C D x4
 
[Verse 1]
            A        G                   C         D
Oh, when we met you thought that I could probably change
             A           G        C          D
I warned you then, that baby, I don't seem insane
               A           G         C           D
But I fucking am and I'm rocking a little gold chain
                  A       G             C           D
That ain't real gold, I told you that it's fucking fake
             A        G         C        D
I spend my money elsewhere on different things
               A             G        C         D
That come in little plastic bags and they disappear
         A G C D           A G C D
The same night, the same night
 
[Chorus]
              A  G    C     D
I ain't your average normal dude
                A   G       C        D
It sure ain't glamorous, I keep things loose
              A    G   C       D
I ain't your average punk rock loser
             A   G       C     D    Bb Gm
Yeah, I'm a savage, I'm really cool
N.C.                G     A G C D
I tried to warn ya, I'm loose
 
A G C D x3
 
[Verse 2]
A          G                 C           D
I tried to warn ya that I'm bad and I'm loose
      A            G         C          D
I'm looser than a piece of low hanging fruit
      A            G             C               D
And I don't go to parties where folks get dressed up
  A            G               C       D
I go to the function just to fuck shit up
A           G                 C          D
I warned you baby that ain't juice in my cup
        A      G          C      D
It's promethazine and a little 7 Up
  A           G            C           D
I tried to warn ya that I'm bad and I'm loose
     A             G       C           D
I'm looser than a piece of low hanging fruit
 
[Chorus]
              A  G    C     D
I ain't your average normal dude
                A   G       C        D
It sure ain't glamorous, I keep things loose
              A    G   C       D
I ain't your average punk rock loser
             A   G       C     D    Bb Gm
Yeah, I'm a savage, I'm really cool
N.C      G  A G C D
I'm loose!
            A         G C D
I said I'm loose, baby!
 
A G C D x4
 
[Verse 3]
                 A            G                C          D
I'm drenched in sweat when I wake up, need to hang up my sheets
           A          G               C          D
Pour up a beer and walk out with my shoes on my feet
     A               G           C       D
And I don't need nobody tell me how to dress
 A              G              C             D
I look in the mirror saying, "Man, you're the best"
   A           G              C       D
And I'm sorry, honey, but I gotta confess
       A           G                 C            D
Don't give a fuck about you, I could really care less
 
[Chorus]
              A  G    C     D
I ain't your average normal dude
                A   G       C        D
It sure ain't glamorous, I keep things loose
              A    G   C       D
I ain't your average punk rock loser
             A   G       C     D
Yeah, I'm a savage, I'm really cool
Bb
I'm really cool
            Gm
And most of all
N.C.
I'm loose
