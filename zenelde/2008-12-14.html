[Verse 1]
 D                  Am7
I, I'm a one way motorway
                C                Em7              D
I'm a road that drives away and follows you back home
 D                    Am7
I, I'm a streetlight shining
                  C                 Em7              D
I'm a white light blinding bright, burning off and on
 
[Chorus]
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these you learn to live again
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these you give and give again
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these you learn to love again
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these time and time again

[Verse 2]
 D                 Am7
I, I'm a new day rising
                 C                Em7           D
I'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
 D                        Am7
but I, I'm a little divided
               C            Em7              D
do I stay or run away and leave it all behind
 
[Chorus]
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these you learn to live again
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these you give and give again
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these you learn to love again
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these time and time again
 
[Chorus]
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these you learn to live again
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these you give and give again
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these you learn to love again
    C                       Em7              D
It's times like these time and time again
 
    C                       Em7              Dsus2
It's times like these you learn to live again
    C                       Em7              Dsus2
It's times like these you give and give again
    C                       Em7              Dsus2
It's times like these you learn to love again
    C                       Em7              Dsus2 C
It's times like these time and time again
