[Verse 1]
G              D
Bobby’s just a friend of mine
     C
He’s on his back
    G      D
I’m on his mind
   G                D
He wakes me when he goes to work
    C
His hands are cold
    G         D
His breath is smoke
 
[Chorus 1]
    Am            C
I’d leave him for you
   G           D
If you want me to
    Am            C
I’d leave him for you
   G           D
If you want me to
    Am            C
I’d leave him for you
   G           D
If you want me to
    Am            C
I’d leave him for you
   G           D
If you want me to
 
[Verse 2]
G                  D
Do you forget when we first met
    C
You grabbed my hand
  G         D
I tore your dress
  G                D
I felt things I cannot express
      C
But I lost my way
  G       D
I made my mess
 
[Chorus 2]
    Am           C
I’d clean it for you
   G           D
If you want me to
    Am           C
I’d clean it for you
   G           D
If you want me to
    Am           C
I’d clean it for you
   G           D
If you want me to
    Am           C
I’d clean it for you
   G           D
If you want me to
 
[Bridge]
    Em                 D
But I know what you’re doing
Em                 D
I know what you’re doing
C      G
I know you
C      G
I know you
  C    G    D        Em
I do I do I tell you what
 
[Instrumental]
Am C G D (x4)
 
[Verse 3]
G                D
I paint pictures of my heart
    C               G      D
The colors blue and purple start
   G             D
To bleed into an endless dark
     C             G    D
It’s only you it’s only you
 
[Chorus 3]
    Am            C
I’d burn them for you
   G           D
If you want me to
    Am            C
I’d burn them for you
   G           D
If you want me to
    Am            C
I’d burn them for you
   G           D
If you want me to
    Am            C
I’d burn them for you
   G           D
If you want me to
 
    Em                 D
But I know what you’re doing
Em                 D
I know what you’re doing
C      G
I know you
C      G
I know you
  C    G    D        Em
I do I do I tell you what
