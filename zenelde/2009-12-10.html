This whole earth is gonna reel and rock
Saints will tremble and cry for pain
For the Lord's gonna come in his heaven airplane.</i>

 F#m  D  A  E 

   F#m       D     A              E 
If God had a name,  what would it be?
              F#m             D    A
And would you call it to his face 
             E    
If you were faced with him
   F#m      D      A                E 
In all his glory     what would you ask?
            F#m      D      A    E    
If you had just one question?

 D      Asus4    E      Esus4
Yeah... yeah... God is great
 D      Asus4    E      Esus4
Yeah... yeah... God is good
D       Asus4    E
Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah...

        F#m     D         A  E
What if God was one of us?
        F#m      D        A  E
Just a slob like one of us?
         F#m    D      A             E                 F#m  D  A  E
Just a stranger on the bus trying to make his way home  

If God had a face, what would it look like 
And would you want to see?
If seeing meant that you would have to believe, 
In things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints and all the prophets

Trying to make his way home...
Like up to heaven all alone...
Nobody calling on the phone...
Except for the Pope, maybe in Rome.
