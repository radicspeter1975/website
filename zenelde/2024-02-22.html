  Bm A                          Bm 
     Here they come with their  make-up on 
     D                               A 
as  lovely as the clouds, come and  see them, 
 A                         Bm 
Boys and girls and their  mums and their words 
           D                           A 
and their  romances and jobs and their  sons, 
 A                  Bm 
Barking mad kids,  lonely dads 
    D                          A 
who drug it up to give it some meaning, 
 A                    Bm 
From the raves to the council estates 
         D                                C 
they're reminding us there's things to be done
 
  E                    D               A 
But you and me, all we  want to be is  lazy, 
  E        D     A     Bm 
you and  me, so  lazy...   

Here they come gone 7am 
getting satellite and Sky getting cable, 
Bills and Bens and their mums and their friends 
who just really, really want to be loved, 
Uncle Teds and their legendary vests 
helping out around the disabled, 
From the flats and the maisonettes 
they're reminding us there's things to be done

But you and me, all we want to be is lazy, 
you and me, so lazy... 
It¹s you and me, it's you and me, you and me...
