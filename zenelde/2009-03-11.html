INTRO
D Am G Dsus/F# Em  PLAY TWICE

VERSE 1

D                                 Bm   
  I can't sleep tonight, everybody saying everything is alright
D                                Bm
Still I can't close my eyes, I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
G                 A   G                                A
Sunny days,where have you gone
     G                   Em                          A
I get the strangest feeling, you belong

CHORUS
D                              A
Why does it always rain on me
G                           Em
Is it because I lied when I was 17
D                              A
Why does it always rain on me
G                                              Em
Even when the sun is shining  I can't avoid the lightning

D                                      Bm
I can't stand myself, I'm being held up by invisible men
D                                      Bm          
Still life on a shelf, when I got my mind on something else
G                 A      G
Sunny day's where have you gone
   G                         Em                       A
I get the strangest feeling you belong

CHORUS
Bm                            D
Oh where did the blue sky go,
Bm                              D   C  Am7       Asus4
oh and why is it raining so, its so cold

REPEAT 1ST VERSE

Chorus
D                                   A           G                       Em
Why does it always rain on me, is because I lied when I was 17
D                        A            G
Why does it rain on me, even when the sun is shining
Em
I can't avoid the lightning
D                             Am      G      Em
Why does it always rain on me
D                                 Am      G         Em       D
Why does it always rain on, on
