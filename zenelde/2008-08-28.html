VERSE 2
Glance, don't stare
Soon you're being told to recognize your heirs
No, not me -- I'm an island of such great complexity
Stress surrounds in the muddy peaceful center of this town
Tell me off in the hotel lobby right in front of all the bellboys and the
over-friendly concierge

CHORUS
A shady lane, everybody wants one
A shady lane, everybody needs one
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh your god, oh his god, oh her god
It's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's
everybody's god
The worlds collide, but all that I want is a shady lane.
