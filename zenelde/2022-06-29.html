[Chorus]
***repeat above bass line***
 
You hobo humpin' slobo babe
Get it off, get off, get off of me
You hobo humpin' slobo babe
Get it off, get off, get off of me
 
Baby we don't love ya
Baby we don't love ya, baby yeah
Baby we don't love ya
Baby we don't love ya, baby yeah
Baby we don't love ya
Baby we don't love ya, baby yeah
  
[Verse 1]
Seeking candy, on the shore
Lost her eyesight, teeth are poor
Left for dead, back for more
Left for dead
 
Seeking candy, who sleeps around
Afraid of telling, tiny sounds
Left for dead, left for good
Left for dead, not understood
But you always came back for more
  
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Seeking candy, out of line
Broken kneecap, velvet spine
Left for dead, left for good
Left for dead, misunderstood
But you always came back for more
