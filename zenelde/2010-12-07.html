    Em D C B Em D C B
     
    [Verse]
    Em
    The drugs they say
    D C B
    Make us feel so hollow
    Em
    We love in vain
    D C B
    Narcissistic and so shallow
    Em
    The cops and queers
    D C B
    To swim you have to swallow
    Em
    Hate today
    D C B
    No love for tomorrow
    Em D C B
    We're all stars now in the dope show
    Em D C B
    We're all stars now in the dope show
     
     
    E5                      G5
    There's lots of pretty, pretty ones
     
    D5                  C5  B5
    Who want to get you high
    E5                  G5
    But all the pretty, pretty ones
    D5             C5  B5
    Will leave you low
    C5            B5
    And blow your mind

    [Chorus]
    E5        G5                 A5      D5
    They love you when you're on all the covers
    E5          G5            A5   D5
    When you're not then they love another
    E5        G5                 A5      D5
    They love you when you're on all the covers
    E5          D5            C5   G5
    When you're not then they love another
     
     
    [Verse]
    Em
    The drugs they say
    D C B
    Are made in California
    Em
    We love your face
    D C B
    We'd really like to sell you
    Em
    The cops and queers
    D C B

    But all the pretty, pretty ones
    D5             C5  B5
    Will leave you low
    C5            B5
    And blow your mind
