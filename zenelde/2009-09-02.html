[Bm]    [A] [F#]    [G]
Love and hate get it wrong
She cut me right back down to size
Sleep the day let it fade
Who was there to take your place

No one knows never will
Mostly me but mostly you
What do you say do you do
When it all comes down

[D] [A] [G]
Cause I don’t wanna come back down from this cloud
Taken me all this time to find out what I need
Yea

I don’t wanna come back down from this cloud
Taken me all this all this time 

[Bm]    [A] [F#]    [G]
There is no blame only shame
When you beg you just complain
More I come more I try
All police are paranoid

So am I - so’s the future
So are you - be a creature
What do you say do you do
When it all comes down

[D] [A] [G]
Cause I don’t wanna come back down from this cloud
Taken me all this time to find out what I need
Yea, yea yea

I don’t wanna come back down from this cloud
Taken me all this all this time

[Bm]    [A] [F#]    [G]
Love and hate get it wrong
She cut me right back down to size
Sleep the day let it fade
Who was there to take your place

No one knows never will
Mostly me but mostly you
What do you say do you do
When it all comes down

[D] [A] [G]
Cause I don’t wanna come back down from this cloud
Taken me all this time to find out what I need
Yea, yea, yea

I don’t wanna come back down from this cloud
Taken me all this all this time
