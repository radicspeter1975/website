Verse:

Step out the front door like a ghost
into the fog where no one notices
the contrast of white on white.
And in between the moon and you
the angels get a better view
of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.
I walk in the air between the rain
through myself and back again
Where?  I don't know
Maria says she's dying
through the door I hear her crying
Why?  I don't know

Chorus:

      C      D                  Em     G
Round here we always stand up straight
      C    D             Em    G
Round here something radiates

Verse:

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
she said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
she parks her car outside of my house
takes her clothes off
says she's close to understanding Jesus
she knows she's just a little misunderstood
she has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

Chorus:

      C          D                Em    G
Round here we're carving out our names
      C    D                Em   G
Round here we all look the same
      C                       D
Round here we talk just like lions
        Em             G
But we sacrifice like lambs
    C             D                  Em     G
Round here she's slipping through my hands

Bridge:  (Please fill in the blanks)
Sleeping children got to run like the wind
out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
out of the lightning

Verse:

She says It's only in my head
She says Shhh I know it's only in my head
But the girl in car in the parking lot
says "Man you should try to take a shot
can't you see my walls are crumbling?"
Then she looks up at the building 
and says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
she must be tired of something

Chorus:

      C           D            Em    G
Round here she's always on my mind
      C            D           Em   G
Round here hey man got lots of time
      C                            D
Round here we're never sent to bed early
    Em               G
And nobody makes us wait
      C               D           Em         G       
Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late
