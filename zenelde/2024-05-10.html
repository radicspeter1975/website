[Verse 1]
D               G
I don't care if Monday's blue
D                  A
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Bm             G
Thursday I don't care about you
     D             A
It's Friday I'm in love
 
[Verse 2]
D              G
Monday you can fall apart
D                 A
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Bm             G
Thursday doesn't even start
     D             A
It's Friday I'm in love
 
[Chorus]
G        A
Saturday wait
Bm              G
And Sunday always comes too late
    D            A
But Friday never hesitate...
 
[Verse 3]
D               G
I don't care if Mondays black
D                 A
Tuesday Wednesday heart attack
Bm           G
Thursday never looking back
     D             A
It's Friday I'm in love
 
[Interlude]
D  G  D  A  Bm  G  D  A
 
[Verse 4]
D              G
Monday you can hold your head
D                 A
Tuesday Wednesday stay in bed
   Bm               G
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
D                  A
It's Friday I'm in love
 
[Chorus]
G        A
Saturday wait
Bm              G
And Sunday always comes too late
    D            A
But Friday never hesitate...
 
[Bridge]
Bm                C                         D
Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
            A                       Bm
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
                   C                             D
Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound
                   A
And as sleek as a shriek spinning round and round
Bm                C                           D
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
         A                          Bm
To see you eat in the middle of the night
                    C                    D
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
           A
It's Friday I'm in love
 
[Repeat Verse 1]
D               G
I don't care if Monday's blue
D                  A
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Bm             G
Thursday I don't care about you
     D             A
It's Friday I'm in love
 
[Repeat Verse 2]
D              G
Monday you can fall apart
D                 A
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Bm             G
Thursday doesn't even start
     D             A
It's Friday I'm in love
