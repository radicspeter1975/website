Capo 4th Fret (Am=c#m)
 
[Intro]
Am  F  C  Em
 
[Verse]
        Am
Oh, the wind whistles down
    F
The cold dark street tonight
        C                       Em
And the people they were dancing to the music vibe
        Am
And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
          F
While the shy tormented youth sit way over there
        C
And the songs they get louder
                       Em
Each one better than before
 
[Chorus]
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                       F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                    C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                        Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight
 
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                       F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                    C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                        Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight
                        Am
Where you gonna sleep tonight
 
[Instrumental]
(Am)  F  C  Em
 
[Verse]
          Am
So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four
           F
And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
    C                                 Em
But nobody's in and nobody's home 'til four
          Am
So you're sitting there with nothing to do
         F
Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
    C                                                    Em
And where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep tonight
 
[Chorus]
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                       F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                    C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                        Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
 
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                       F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                    C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
                         Am
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
 
[Instrumental]
(Am)  F  C  Em
 Am   F  C  Em
 
[Chorus]
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                       F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                    C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
 
...
 
[Outro]
(Am)  F  C  Em  Am
