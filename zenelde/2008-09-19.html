        A                    D 
I’ve been looking so long at these      pictures of you 
that I     almost believe that they’re  real 
I’ve been   living so long with my    pictures of you           
        
  D          A           D   
that I      almost believe that the     pictures are all I can feel
             A                  D 
        Remembering you standing   quiet in the rain 
as  I      ran to your heart to be    near 
and we  kissed as the sky fell in    holding close 
how I   always held close in your   fear 
        remembering you running    soft through the night 
you were bigger and brighter and   wider than snow 
and    screamed at the make-believe screamed at the sky     
 A                      D             A      D       
and you finally found all your       courage to let it all go    
 
             A               D 
         remembering   you   fallen   into my arms 
          crying for the death of your  heart 
you were stone white so delicate        lost in the cold 
you were always so lost in   the       dark 
         remembering you how         you used to be 
slow   drowned you were angels so    much more than everything 
oh        hold for the last time then   slip away quietly  
          open my eyes but I          never see anything 
 
    E                D 
If only I’d thought of the       right words 
I could have held onto your    heart 
if only I’d thought of the       right words 
   E                Bm7             A 
I wouldn’t be breaking       apart      all my pictures of you 
 
A               D 
looking so long at these  pictures of you, but I  
never hold onto   your   heart 
looking so long for the   words to be true, but 
A               D              A    
always just breaking         apart my pictures of you  
 
A   Bm7 A/C#    D   A/C#    D   A/E (5 fr)  D/F# (7
fr) 
 
        A               Bm7 
there was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more 
      A/C#                  D 
than to  feel you deep in my heart 
       A/C#         D 
there was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more  
     A/E (5 fr)           D/F# (7 fr)            
than to never feel the breadking apart my pictures of you 
 
A   Bm7 A/C#    D   A/C#    D   A/E (5 fr)  D/F# (7
fr)     A
