[Intro]

[Verse]
F
when you think about it 
he's watching
every word you
D     F      D         F
say   hey    dazed and when 
F
he's sussed you out 
he calls her up and out
she comes and
D   F    D   F
hustles us 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A#     G
long   digging 
A#     G
gone   fishing 
A#     G
love   drinking 
 
[Chorus]
D                     G
the bartender and the thief are lovers 
D                         G
steal what they need like sisters and brothers 
D                 G
met in a church a night to remember 
D                     G
robbing the graves of bodies dismembered 
 
(Continue Pattern for Rest Of Song)
he watched the lesbian talk she kissed and
groped but mostly talked in lust crushed
he couldn't make the call his eyes were
gripped on licking tongues enough's enough
failed for once
long digging gone fishing love
drinking
the bartender and the thief are lovers
steal what they need like sisters and
brothers
met in a church a night to remember
robbing the graves of bodies
dismembered
saved what they stole to meet at the alter
place where they first set eyes on each
other
flew to the sun to start life all over
set up a bar and robbed all the locals
