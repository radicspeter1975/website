F
Marky got with Sharon
    G
And Sharon got Sherese
        F                               G
She was sharin’ Sharon's outlook on the topic of disease
F                           G
Mikey had a facial scar and Bobby was a racist
          F                                  G
They were all in love with dyin’, they were doin' it in Texas
F                         G
Tommy played piano like a kid out in the rain
        F                             G
Then he lost his leg in Dallas he was dancing’ with a train
          F                                 G
They were all in love with dyin’, they were drink in’ from a fountain
         F                          G
That was pouring like an avalanche, com in’ down the mountain

G                         
I don’t mind the sun sometimes
    F         G
The images it shows
G
I can taste you on my lips
    F               G
And smell you in my clothes
G
Cinnamon and sugary
    F             G
And softly spoken lies
G
You never know just how you look
        F             G
Through other people’s eyes

Some will die in hot pursuit and fiery auto crashes
Some will die in hot pursuit while sifting through my ashes
Some will fall in love with life and drink it from a fountain
That is pouring like an avalanche, com in’ down the mountain

[Chorus]

In Reverse:
G
(I don’t mind the sun sometimes
    F         G       
The images it shows
G         
You never know just how you look
        F              G
Through other people’s eyes)

Another Mikey took a knife while arguing in traffic
Flipper died a natural death, he caught a nasty virus
Then there was an ever-present football player rapist
They were all in love with dyin’, they were doin' it in Texas
Pauly caught a bullet, but it only hit his leg
Well it should’ve been a better shot and got him in the head
They were all in love with dyin’, they were drink in’ from a fountain
That was pouring like an avalanche, com in’ down the mountain

[Chorus]
