Am  C   Em
All is quite on New Year's Day

Am     C        Em
A world in white, gets underway

Am    C            Em
I want to be with you, be with you night and day

Am  C      Em       Am
Nothing changes on New Year's Day
    Em
On New Year's Day

Chorus:

G       Am
I will be with you again
G       F   Am   C  Em
I will be with you again

Am  C      Em
Under a blood read sky

Am      C        Em 
A crowd has gathered black and white

Am  C   Em
Arms entwined, the chosen few

Am      C    Em     G
Newspaper say, says, say it's true, it's true

Am
And we can break through
    G          F
Though torn in two, we can be one

G      Am
I, I will begin again
G      F        Am  C  Em  Am
I, I will begin again, yeah
