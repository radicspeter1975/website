Intro:
D Bm G A

Verse1:
        D                Bm
All the things i like to be
        G                    A
Make me scared, cause they're not clear to me
        D                    Bm
I stayed up all night trying to figure out
 G                        A
What i need and what i can live without
  D                  Bm
I don't know, if i'll ever be
        G               A
All the things that i wanna be
         D               Bm
I'm twenty four, i could have done more
        G        A
But there's still so much to explore

D Bm G A x2

Verse2:
        D            Bm
All the things i like to be
        G            A
Still appear to be a mystery
               D                   Bm
Staying up all night, helped me to find
             G             A
An answer to what i was looking for
      D                Bm
And i know, i'll never be
        G                   A
All the things that i wanna be
               D               Bm
Time's running out, passing me by
           G              A
With every day part of me dies
