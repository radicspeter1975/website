[D#]Tar[A#]zan [D#]wasn't a [A#]ladies man 
[D#]He'd just [A#]come along and [D#]swoop 'em up un[A#]der his [Gm]arm like [F]that
[Gm]Quick as a [F]cat in the [Cm]jungle [F] 
But [D#]Clark [A#]Kent, now [D#]there was a [A#]real gent
[D#]He would [A#]not be caught [D#]sittin' aro[A#]und in no [Gm]jungle[F]scape
[Gm]Dumb as an [F]ape doing [Cm]nothing  [F] 

Chorus:

[D#]Superman never [F]made any money [A#]saving the world from [D#]Solomon Grundy
And [A#]sometimes I [D#]despair the [A#]world will never [D#]see another [F]man like him

Hey Bob, Supe had a straight job
Even though he could have smashed through any bank in the United States
He had the strength but he would not
Folks said his family were all dead
Their planet crumbled but Superman he forced himself to carry on
Forget Krypton and keep going

Chorus:

Bb Eb Bb Eb F

Superman never made any money saving the world from Solomon Grundy
And sometimes I despair the world will never see another man like him

Bridge:

[Gm]Tar[F]zan was [Gm]king of the [F]jungle and [D#]lord over all the [A#]apes [F] 
[Gm]But [F]he could [Gm]hardly [F]string together [D#]four wo[A#]rds: " [D# I Tar[A#]zan, you [F]Jane"

Some times when Supe was stopping crimes
I'll bet that he was tempted to just quit and turn his back on man
Join Tarzan in the forest
But he stayed in the city and kept changing clothes in dirty
old phonebooths
Til his work was through and nothing to do but go on home

Chorus:

Bb Eb Bb Eb F
Bb Eb Bb Eb F
Superman never made any money saving the world from Solomon Grundy
And sometimes I despair the world will never see another man like him
And sometimes I despair the world will never see another man like him
