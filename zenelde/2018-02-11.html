g#m E H D#aug? (=Gaug=G+=g-h-eb)

[Intro]
G#m     E       B       G
G#m     E       B       G
 
[Verse 1]
G#m                E
Oceans shape the sides
         B              G
Touching down in the spaces
   G#m                  E
Soaking from a warm goodbye
         B              G
An early rise offers kindly
 
[Interlude]
G#m     E       B       G
G#m     E       B       G
 
[Verse 2]
 G#m
Tonight I sleep to dream
      E
Of a place that's calling me
       B
It is always just a dream
         G
Still I cannot forget what I have seen
     G#m
The crowd's hard to believe
         E
At their faces I'm looking
         B
But your feet I'm following
         G
In soft steps on a path the way you lead
 
[Chorus]
G#m                      E
I don't want to lose myself
           B
It's a whisper
         G
It's a funny thing
     G#m                         E
We fold like icicles on paper shelves
          B        G
It's a pity to appear this way
 
[Verse 3]
       G#m                       E
You're flying when your foreign eyes
            B              G
Trace the heights of the city
 
G#m
Steaming
With rocks and clouds we breathe
       E
Violent skies
A shock to my own body
          B
Speech is wild
Alive sacred and sounding
G
Wild
From across and beyond, oh far beyond
 
[Chorus]
G#m                    E
I don't want to lose myself
          B
It's a whisper
             G
It's a funny thing
    G#m                         E
We fold like icicles on paper shelves
         B         G
It's a pity to appear this way
 
[Bridge]
D#      Cm      C#      C#m Edim (e g bb)
D#      Cm      C#      C#m Edim
D#      Cm      C#      C#m Edim
 
D#
Hold, hold, hold on
 Cm
I swear I saw it somewhere
C#                           C#m            Edim
Waving, waiting, one, two, three, above the wakes that follow
D#
Hold, hold, hold on
 Cm
I swear I saw it somewhere
C#                           C#m            Edim              Gdim
Waving, waiting, one, two, three, above the wakes that follow
 
[Coda]
G#m                    E
I don't want to lose myself
Tonight I sleep to dream of a place that's calling me
          B
It's a whisper
It is always just a dream
             G
It's a funny thing
Still I cannot forget what I have seen
    G#m                         E
We fold like icicles on paper shelves
With rocks and clouds we breathe, a shock to my own body
         B
It's a pity
Alive sacred and sounding
       G
To appear this way
From across and beyond, oh far beyond
