D#5
I wonder what it's like
D#5b                    G#5
seeing through your eyes
C#5                         B5
You've offered me to have a try
                    D#5 , D#5b   
but I was always late
D#5
The filters that I use
D#5b           G#5
give me an excuse
C#
I take away what's real
B                             D# , D#5 
I feel it and it blows my fuse

E5          B5
I hang around

      C5        G5
for another round
E5              B5
I'm hanging around
       C5       G5
for another round
D#5          A#5
I'm hanging on
        B5        F#5
to the same old song
D#5         A#5
I hang around
     B         F#5
for another round
C#               B
Until somethings stops me

( D#5 , D#5b)2X

D#5
I wonder what it's like
D#5b                 G#
walking by your side
C#                         
To think before I talk 
B                                        D#5 , D#5b
and to move at the same speed as you walk
D#5
I want to have a weight
D#5b                     G#
to keep me in your state
C#
I'm watching from above
B                             D# , D#5
I love it but it's not for me

E5          B5
I hang around
      C5       G5
for another round
E5              B5
I'm hanging around
        C5      G5
for another round
D#5         A#5
I'm hanging on
        B5        F#5         
to the same old song
D#5        A#5
I hang around
    B5         F#5 
for another round
C#5             B5       B5    ( D#5 , A#5 , B5 )
Until somethings stops me
