       E           Emaj7    A/E
    Excuse me but can I be you for a while
       E          Emaj7      A/E        E
    My dog won't bite if you sit real still
                  Emaj7          A/E            E         Asus2
    I got the anti-Christ in the kitchen yellin' at me again
                B
    Yeah I can hear that
          E      Emaj7        A/E        E
    Been saved again by the garbage truck
            Emaj7      A/E
    I got something to say you know
              E
    But nothing comes
        Emaj7      A/E        E
    Yes I know what you think of me
                    Asus2

               B
    Yeah I can hear that
     
    [Chorus]
        Aadd9            B
    But what if I'm a mermaid
               Amaj9
    In these jeans of his
             B7
    With her name still on it
           Aadd9
    Hey but I don't care
          Badd9
    Cause sometimes
           Aadd9
    I said sometime I hear my voice
    B             C#m   D   B5
      And it's been   here

    Who thinks really deep thougts
              Emaj7          A/E          E
    What's so amazing about really deep thoughts

             B
    How's that thought for you
        E        Emaj7       A/E  E
    My scream got lost in a paper cup
                        Emaj7
    You think there's a heaven
               A/E           E
    Where some screams have gone
               Emaj7       A/E
    I got 25 bucks and a cracker
            E             Asus2
    Do you think it's enough
          B
    To get us there
     
    [Chorus]
        Aadd9            B
    But what if I'm a mermaid
