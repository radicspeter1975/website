           A               D                E       - D
 1. Holy man tiptoed his way across the Ganges,
         A                D          E    - D
    the sound of magic music in his ears,
        A          G          D      - E
    videoed by a busload of tourists,
             A                  D             E   - D
    shiny shell suits on, and drinking lemonade.
  
               A                    D                  E    - D
 2. Now, I've got a funny feeling which I bought mail order,
             A        D            E     - D
    from a man in a tee-pee, California.
                 A               G                   D      - E
    He said he once was the great game show performer,
               A           D        E  - D               E  - D
    then he blew all his money away,     blew it all away.
    
               A                       D
 So take me home, don't leave me alone,
                E                     D
 I'm not that good, but I'm not that bad,
              A                   D
 no psycho killer, hooligan guerrilla.
             E                   D
 I dream to riot, oh you should try it,
           A                  D
 R. E. Perot, get gold card soul,
            A          E
 my joy of life is on a roll.
            A          D            E
 And we'll all be the same in the end,
 D                            A   - D - E
    'cos then you're on your own.
 D                        A   - D - E
    Then you're on your own.
  
              A             D               E      - D
 2. Well, we all go happy day glow in the discos,
         A                D            E    - D
    the sound of magic music in our brains,
                 A              G                  D      - E
    someone stumbles to the bathroom with the horrors,
             A                      D                 E   -  D
    says, Lord, give me time, for I've jumped into space,
                   E     - D
    I'm in outer space.
                   A              D      - E - D            E  - D
 + CHORUS  + Na, na, na na na na….      (4x) Na na na.
 D                        A   - D - E
   Then you're on your own.          (4x)
