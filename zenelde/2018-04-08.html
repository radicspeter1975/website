[Verse 1:]
E       C                  E       C
  I believe I can see the future
E            C                 G     F
  Cause I repeat the same routine
E           C               E        C
  I think I used to have a purpose
E          C
  But then again
       G                  F
  That might have been a dream
E           C               E     C
  I think I used to have a voice
E        C            G      F 
  Now I never make a sound
E        C                 E     C
  I just do what I've been told
E          C           G        F
  I really don't want them to come around

Oh, no

[Chorus:]
E  A       C        G           E
   Every day is exactly the same
   A       C        G           E
   Every day is exactly the same
   A           C              G             E
   There is no love here and there is no pain
   A       C        G           E
   Every day is exactly the same

[Verse 2 (same as Verse 1)]
I can feel their eyes are watching
In case I lose myself again
Sometimes I think I'm happy here
Sometimes, yet I still pretend
I can't remember how this got started
But I can tell you exactly how it will end

[Chorus (same as the first Chorus)]

[Bridge:]  E   C x8
           E   G   C   A x4

I'm writing on a little piece of paper
I'm hoping someday you might find
Well I'll hide it behind something
They won't look behind
I'm still inside here
A little bit comes bleeding through
I wish this could have been any other way
But I just don't know, I don't know what else I can do

[Chorus x2]
