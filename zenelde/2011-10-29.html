F            F7                      Bb
I want to be rich and I want lots of money
                    Bbm                      F
I don't care about clever I don't care about funny
                 F7                      Bb
I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds
Bbm                                          F
I heard people die while they are trying to find them

F             F7                        Bb
I'll take my clothes off and it will be shameless
             Bbm                       F
'Cuz everyone knows that's how you get famous
                 F7                        Bb
I'll look at the sun and I'll look in the mirror
                 Bbm                     F
I'm on the right track yeah I'm on to a winner

F        Dm                     Am
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
F        Dm                    Eb
I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
F            Dm                  Am
When do you think it will all become clear?

'Cuz I'm being taken over by The Fear

F             F7                        Bb
Life's about film stars and less about mothers
               Bbm                F
It's all about fast cars cussing each other
                F7                       Bb
But it doesn't matter cause I'm packing plastic
                 Bbm                        F
and that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic
           F7                   Bb
And I am a weapon of massive consumption
                Bbm                              F
and its not my fault it's how I'm programmed to function
                 F7                        Bb
I'll look at the sun and I'll look in the mirror
                 Bbm                       F
I'm on the right track yeah we're on to a winner  

F        Dm                     Am
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
F        Dm                    Eb
I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
F            Dm                  Am
When do you think it will all become clear?
F              Dm                Eb
'Cuz I'm being taken over by The Fear

Forget about guns and forget ammunition
                       Bbm                   F
Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission
               F7                  Bb
Now I'm not a saint but I'm not a sinner
