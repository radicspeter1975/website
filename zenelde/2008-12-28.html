  Em                       EmMaj7            Em7                          Em6
I slept beside the winter and the green is growing slow
  Em                               EmMaj7  Em7                 Em6 
I watched you find the places    hidden by the snow
  C                                            B7
I tripped into a valley that is blue till you can see
                       Em             A                                  Em
I want you to come and walk this world with me.

                G             C         D                    Em
With the light in our eyes   it's hard to see
G                 C             D                Em
Holding on   and on   till we believe.
               G             C          D                    Em
With the light in our eyes   it's hard to see
C                                        B7
  I'm not touched but I'm      aching to be
                       Em             A                                 Em
I want you to come and walk this world with me

And I'm sucked in by the wonder and I'm fucked up by the lies
And I dig a hole to climb in and I get some wings to fly
And I think that I could love you cause you know how to be free
I want you to come and walk this world with me

With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
Holding on and on till we believe
With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
I'm not touched but I'm   aching to be
I want you to come, I want you to come, 
I want you to come, and walk this world with me

Em  EmMaj7  Em7  Em6 x4

And it's burning in our fingers and it's burning on the road
And I like the way you're broken and I like you when you're old
And I see you in the garden and I feel you plant the seed
I want you to come and walk this world with me.

With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
Holding on and on till we believe
With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
Holding on and on till we believe
With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
                                             A
Holding on and on till we believe
I'm not touched but I'm aching to be, dust to dust, yeah, dream to dream
I want you to come, I want you to come, I want you to come walk this world with me
