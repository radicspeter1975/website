Am            Dm           G
When I look back upon my life
            C               F
It's always with a sense of shame
            Dm              E
I've always been the one to blame
Am            Dm           G
For everything I long to do
            C               F
No matter when or where or who
        Dm              E  
Has one thing in common, too

Am, Am, Am, Am, Dm, G
 It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
           Am, Am, Am, Am, Dm, G
 It's a sin
Dm
Everything I've ever done
E
Everything I ever do
Dm
Every place I've ever been
E
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

Am                    Cm
Father, forgive me, I tried not to do it
Ebm                      Am               G
Turned over a new leaf, then tore right through it
Am                       Cm
Whatever you taught me, I didn't believe it
Ebm                             F
Father, you fought me, 'cause I didn't care
      G                E
And I still don't understand

So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too
