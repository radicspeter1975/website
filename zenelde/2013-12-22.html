Capo 4th fret (Em=G#m)

                 Em7        A7        D#m
It ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke
A7                  Em7       A7        D#m
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
A7                  Em7         A7     D#m
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
A7              Em7             A7                 D#m
Hey I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
A7             Em7    A7                     D#m
This is a love attack I know it went out but it's back.
A7              Em7       A7         D#m
It's just like any fad it retracts before impact
A7                    Em7            A7                  D#m
And just like fashion it's a passion for the with it and the hip
A7                           Em7             A7              D#m          A7
If you got the goods they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique

-> Chorus:
Em7            A7      D#m            A7
 So don't delay act now supplies are running out
Em7            A7          D#m               A7
Allow if you're still alive six to eight years to arrive
Em7              A7         D#m        A7
And if you follow there may be a tomorrow
      Em7               A7        B7                         
But if the offer is shun you might as well be walkin' on the sun

                  Em7     A7         D#m            A7
Twenty-five years ago they spoke out and they broke out
             Em7            A7           D#m
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
A7              Em7      A7       D#m        A7
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
             Em7             A7        D#m
Just singin' and clappin' man what the hell happened
A7                  Em7        A7
Then some were spellbound some were hellbound
D#m            A7                Em7        A7
Some they fell down and some got back up and
             D#m            A7
Fought back 'gainst the melt down
                    Em7           A7      D#m
And their kids were hippie chicks all hypocrites
  A7            Em7             A7           D#m      A7
Because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it

Repeat Chorus

Instr.: | Em7  A7 | D#m  A7 | Em7  A7 | D#m  A7 |
        | Em7  A7 | D#m  A7 | Em7  A7 | B7 |

It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up so choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus
             Em7       A7                  D#m            A7
So don't sit back kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked
                   Em7          A7       D#m
News at 10:00 your neighborhood is under attack
A7                   Em7           A7        D#m
Put away the crack before the crack puts you away
    A7                 Em7            A7         B7
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

Repeat Chorus

Em7    A7            D#m             A7         Em7    A7     
         You might as well be walkin' on the sun
            D#m             A7         Em7    A7
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
            D#m             A7         Em7    A7
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
            D#m             A7      Bm
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
