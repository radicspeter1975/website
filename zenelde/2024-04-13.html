[Intro]
A   Bm   D   Asus2  2x
 
[Verse]
 A
25 years of my life and still
 Bm                                      D
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
           Asus2
for a destination.
 A
I realized quickly when I knew I should
            Bm                                    D
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man,
                     Asus2
for whatever that means.
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         A
And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed
        Bm                                   D
just to get all out, what's in my head, then I,
                            Asus2
I'm feeling, a little peculiar.
           A
And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside
      Bm                                           D
And I take a deep breath, and I get real high, and I,
                                               Asus2
scream from the top of my lungs, "What's going on?"
 
[Chorus]
            A                  Bm
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
            A                  Bm
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus2
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
 
[Interlude]
Oooh ohh...
A   Bm   D   Asus
Oooh ohh... 
A   Bm   D   Asus
 
[Verse]
           A               Bm
And I try, oh my god, do I try
               D                 Asus
I try all the time, in this institution.
 A                          Bm
And I pray, oh my god, do I pray
                    D              Asus2
I pray every single day, for a revolution.
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         A
And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed
         Bm                                  D
just to get all out, what's in my head, then I,
                         Asus2
I'm feeling, a little peculiar.
          A
And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside 
      Bm                                           D
And I take a deep breath, and I get real high, and I,
                                               Asus2
scream from the top of my lungs, "What's going on?"
 
[Chorus]
             A                 Bm
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
            A                  Bm
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
 
             A                 Bm
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus2
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
            A                  Bm
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus2
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
 
[Interlude]
Oooh ohh...
A   Bm   D   Asus
Oooh ohh... 
A   Bm   D   Asus
