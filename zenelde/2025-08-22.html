<pre>
Db               Bbm
she tattooed her failures on her arms
Fm        Gb
which ran wrists to shoulderblades
Db            Bbm
she wore them above her charm bracelet
Fm           Gb
given to her on her birthday
Db             Bbm
a silver wrist bound carousel
Fm           Gb
given to her by her father
Db             Bbm
so bright back then but tarnished since,
Fm             Gb
she used to be the favorite daughter
 
[Chorus]
Eb      Cb
that no longer applies
Eb         Cb
expiration date went by
Eb          Cb
you used to be so pretty
 
[Verse 2]
Db       Bbm
knuckles crack from faulty swings
Fm      Gb
leaving memories of him
Db           Bbm
imprinted in the purple yellow browns
Fm      Gb
that only recently began
Db           Bbm
to fade back to the colors
Fm             Gb
you are really supposed to be
Db          Bbm
in sickened ways you guiltily
Fm         Gb
found them to be so pretty
 
[Chorus]
Eb             Cb
your long face wears long sleeves
Eb             Cb
to hide what's underneath
Eb            Cb
everyone just thinks your clumsy
 
[Bridge]
D  G   Em  A
 
[Verse]
D               Bm
the blue backed cards could only be
F#m      G
used for flimsy construction
D             Bm
after he took the royalty
F#m       G
and lined his spokes with them
D      Bm
ferris wheels of noble men
F#m       G
spray out the perfect rhythm
D             Bm
the dirt hill jumps were always best
F#m      G
he found out by the prison
 
[Outro]
Em                C
that's where your real father lives
Em                C
he didn't go down with his ship
Em                C
that's just what your mother told you
 
Go
 
D   Bm   F#m   G     D
