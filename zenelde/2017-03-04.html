fél hanggal mélyebben (A=G#)

[Intro] A C G D (x2)

[Verse 1]
A            C     G                     D
  Born to be down,   I've learned all my lessons before now...
A            C     G                    D
  Born to be down,   I think you'll get used to it.

x2        A                      C
  And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic.
          G                           D
  And you learn to accept it, And you know it's so pathetic.

[Chorus]
        A     C           G     D 
And you don't...  And you don't...
        A     C           G     D
And you don't...  And you don't...

[Verse 2]
A            C     G                   D
  Born to be down,   I think that I've said this before now...
A            C     G              D
  Born to be down,   What good is confidence?

x2        A                      C
  And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic.
          G                           D
  And you learn to accept it, And you know it's so pathetic.

[Chorus]
        A     C           G     D 
And you don't...  And you don't...
        A     C           G     D
And you don't...  And you don't...

[Verse 3]
x4        A                      C
  And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic.
          G                           D
  And you learn to accept it, And you know it's so pathetic.

[Bridge]
          A     C  G  D
  And you don't...
  A  C  G  D

[Verse 4]
x6        A                      C
  And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic.
          G                           D
  And you learn to accept it, And you know it's so pathetic.

[Outro]
          A     C  G  D
  And you don't...
  A  C  G  D
