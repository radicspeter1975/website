fél hanggal mélyebben (E=Eb)
[Intro]
E E D A x4
 
[Verse 1]
E              D               E
  Dear Mother, can you hear me whining?
E                 D                      G                B
  It's been three whole weeks since that I have left your home
E             D                E
  This sudden fear has left me trembling
E              D               G              B
 'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
        G           B
And I'm feeling so alone...
 
[Chorus]
E             G                      A              C
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
E              G                   B
  Some call it slums, some call it nice...
  E                G                     A               C
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
E  B N.C.       E        D A
     Welcome to Paradise
 
E E D A
 
[Verse 2]
E           D                E
  A gunshot rings out at the station
E         D                 G                B
  Another urchin snaps, and left dead on his own
E             D              E
  It makes me wonder why I'm still here
E                  D               G               B
  For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
        G           B
And I'm never gonna go...
 
[Chorus]
E             G                      A              C
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
E              G                   B
  Some call it slums, some call it nice...
  E                G                     A               C
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
E  B N.C.       E        D A
     Welcome to Paradise
 
E E D A x3

[Verse 3]
E              D               E
  Dear Mother, can you hear me laughing?
E               D                       G                B
  It's been six whole months since that I have left your home
E             D              E
  It makes me wonder why I'm still here
E                  D               G               B
  For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
        G           B
And I'm never gonna go...
 
[Chorus]
E             G                      A              C
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
E              G                   B
  Some call it slums, some call it nice...
  E                G                     A               C
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
E  B N.C.       E        D A
     Welcome to Paradise
