Capo on 1

INTRO 
   G                D                 Em
   G                D                 Em

VERSE1:
G                                    D 
   You know I never meant to see you again
                          Em         D 
And I only passed by as a friend
G                                D 
   All this time I stayed out of sight
                    Em
I started wondering why?

CHORUS:
C                      D                  C 
Now I, I wish it would rain down, down on me
                    D                     C 
Yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
                    D                  C 
Yes I wish it would rain down, down on me
                    D 
Yes I wish it would rain on me

VERSE2:

You said you didn't need a me in your life
I guess you were right
Well I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again

BRIDGE:
G              A                   C              G 
   Though your hurt is gone, mines hanging on, inside
           G                            A 
And I know, its eating me through every night and day
         C               G 
I'm just waiting on your sign
G                  D 
'Cos I know, I know  I never meant to cause you no pain
      Em                        D 
And I realize I let you down
G 
   But I know in my heart of hearts
D                                  Em
   I knew I'm never gonna hold you again

Now I, I wish it would rain down...
