[Verse 1]
     F#              A#5                  F#
They say I need some Rogaine to put in my hair
F#                 A#5                F#
Working out at the gym to fit my underwear
F#               A#5                     F#
Oakley makes the shades that transform a tool
      F#                   A#5                      F#
You'd hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool
 
[Chorus]
      F#                   C#
I'mma do the things that I wanna do
  D#m                  B
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
     F#                    C#
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
  D#m                  B
Excuse my manners if I make a scene
  F#                   C#
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
    D#m                     B
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
    F#                         C#
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
  C#m                     B
I don't give a hoot about what you think
 
[Verse 2]
F#                A#5              F#
Everyone likes to dance to a happy song
       F#                A#5                    F#
With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along
F#                  A#5                         F#
Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts
F#                   A#5                    A#5
Maybe if I work with him, I can perfect the art
 
[Chorus]
      F#                   C#
I'mma do the things that I wanna do
  D#m                  B
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
     F#                    C#
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
  D#m                  B
Excuse my manners if I make a scene
  F#                   C#
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
    D#m                     B
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
    F#                         C#
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
  C#m                     B
I don't give a hoot about what you think
 
[Bridge]
   A#m           A#m
No I don't care, I don't care
A#m                                                  B    B B B C#
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
 
[Chorus]
      F#                   C#
I'mma do the things that I wanna do
  D#m                  B
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
     F#                    C#
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
  D#m                  B
Excuse my manners if I make a scene
  F#                   C#
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
    D#m                     B
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
    F#                         C#
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
  C#m                     B
I don't give a hoot about what you think
