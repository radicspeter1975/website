[Intro]
Bm7 B7sus4  x8
 
[Verse 1]
A              Bm
I woke up and called this morning
A                 Bm
The tone of your voice was a warning
C               G             Bm7 - B7sus4 - Bm7 - B7sus4
That you don't care for me anymore
A             Bm
I made up the bed we sleep in
A               Bm
I looked at the clock when you creep in
C            G        Bm7 - B7sus4 - Bm7 - B7sus4
It's 6 a.m. and  I'm alone
 
[Chorus]
D       G6 F#m-5   Em               C(1)
Did you know when you go It's the perfect ending
D      G6 F#m-5     Em      Em+
To the bad day I was just beginning
D        G6 F#m-5    Em         C(1)            G      C(1)
When you go all I know is   You're my favorite mistake
 
[Solo]
Bm7 - B7sus4 - Bm7 - B7sus4 / Bm7 - B7sus4 - Bm7 - B7sus4
 
[Verse 2]
A                     Bm
Well, your friends are sorry for me
A                Bm
They watch you pretend to adore me
C          G            Bm7 - B7sus4 - Bm7 - B7sus4
But I'm no fool to this game
A                    Bm
Now here comes your secret lover
A                   Bm
She'd be unlike any other
C          G                Bm7 - B7sus4 - Bm7 - B7sus4
Until your guilt goes up in flames
 
[Chorus]
D       G6 F#m-5         Em             C(1)
Did you know when you go  It's the perfect ending
D         G6 F#m-5        Em        Em+
To the bad day I've gotten used to spending
D        G6 F#m-5    Em        C(1)                 G
When you go all I know is   You're my favorite mistake
C(1)                    G     C(1)
You're my favorite mistake
Bm(1)             A#
Well maybe nothin' lasts forever
F                  G
Even when you stay together
Bm(1)           A#
I don't need forever after
F                            Em
It's your laughter won't let me go
Em                     Em
So I'm holding on this way
 
[Solo]
D  G6 F#m-5  Em  C(1)
D  G6 F#m-5  Em  Em+
D  G6 F#m-5  Em  C(1)   G   C(1)
 
[Chorus]
D       G6 F#m-5      Em              C(1)
Did you know, could you tell You were the only one
D       G6 F#m-5   Em    Em+
That  I  ever       loved
D    G6 F#m-5      Em      C(1)   G   C(1)
Now  everything's   so    wrong
D        G6 F#m-5   Em        C(1)
Did you  see me     walking   by
D       G6 F#m-5      Em    Em+  -  D - G6 F#m-5 Em
Did it  ever   make   you    cry
Em       C(1)        G
You're my favorite mistake
C(1)                 G
You're my favorite mistake
C(1)                 G     C(1)   Bm(1)   (FADE-OUT).
You're my favorite mistake
