Once in a while

When I'm sleeping

My horses are wild

You made me see
             G
Sparks come blazing
               Dm
I was lucky to be
              G              Asus4  A
Made to feel like I had been loved

I didn't think you would sacrifice
F                          G        F#
U-u, the love I made you receive, no, no
F                         G
I'd pay a grand for some paradise
Asus4                        A
but I'm just too scared to believe, o-o-oh!
