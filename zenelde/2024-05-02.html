I had a dream,
G/D
When I was young,
D7         G/D
A dream of sweet illusion,

A glimpse of hope and unity,
     D7                  G/D
And visions of one sweet union,
      Bb/D
But a cold wind blows,
      Dm9
And a dark rain falls,
          Bb/D
And in my heart it shows,
Dm9                          Bb/D    D5
Look what they've done to my dream.
