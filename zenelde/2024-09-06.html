[Intro]
A  D
 
[Verse 1]
A                                D
Starry nights city lights coming down over me
A                                D
Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
A                                D
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
F#m                 E                  D
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
F#m            E                D
Lost and found city bound in my dreams
 
[Chorus]
(E)
And screaming
A                                D
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
(E)
And screaming
A                                D
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
 
[Verse 2]
A                                          D
Forget me nots and second thoughts live in isolation
A                                   D
Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
A                                D
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
F#m                    E           D
The rage and love, the story of my life
F#m             E          D
The Jesus of suburbia is a lie
 
[Chorus/Outro] (x2)
(E)
And screaming
A                                D
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
(E)
And screaming
A                                D
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
