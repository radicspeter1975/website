Intro
E(v2) F#m AMaj7 A(v1) E(v1) (2x)

Verse
F#m                            Aadd9                                E(v1)
Two jumps in a week, I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy

Flyin' on your motorcycle, watching all the ground beneath you drop

You'd kill yourself for recognition, kill yourself to never ever stop

You broke another mirror, you're turning into something you are not

Chorus
               F#m  A(v2)           E(v1)
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry


Drying up in conversation, you will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces, you just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you when you think you've got the world
all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you, you will be the one screaming out

[chorus]

Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

chorus
So don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
