Intro
F--Dm--Bb--C--; (2X)

  F
Enola Gay
                                  Dm
You should have stayed at home yesterday
             Bb
Uh-huh, it's kinda of sly
                      C
The feelin' and the way of life

       F
These games you play
                             Dm
They're gonna end in all the tears someday
        Bb
Uh-huh, Enola Gay
                           C
It shouldn't ever have to end this way

Ad lib
F--Dm--Bb--C--


(1st verse chords)
At 8:15
And that's the time that it's always been
We got your message on the radio
Collision's novel and your comin' home

Ad lib
F--Dm-Bb--C--;(2X)

(1st verse chords)
Enola Gay
It's not the proud little voice today
Uh-huh, this kiss you give
It's never ever gonna fade
       hold Bb-C--
  away.

(Repeat 1st Ad lib)

(1st verse chords)

It shouldn't ever have to end this way

It should have ever been our dreams away
