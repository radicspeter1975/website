INTRO - Verse chord sequence twice

          E                       B
It was strange glue that held us together
         A                       C#m   B
While we both came apart at the seams
             E 
She said: Your place or mine
             B
While we've still got the time
   A                       C#m       B
So I played along with her schemes

       F#                         B
But I don't have the right to be with you tonight
          Ab                      C#m
So please leave me alone with no saviour in sight
         G                       B
I will sleep safe and sound with nobody around me

E                  B
When faced with my demons
A                 C#m B
I clothe them and feed them
         E               B
And I'll smile, yes I'll smile
                     A     C#m  B
As they're taking me over

    C#m                       A7
And if I cannot sleep for the secrets I keep
         B                    A
It's the price I'm willing to meet
    E                      B                     A
The end of the night never comes too quickly for me

SOLO over verse chords

      F#                         B
But I don't have the right to be with you tonight
          Ab                     C#m
So please leave me alone with no saviour
         G                        B
I will sleep safe and sound with nobody around me

E                  B
When faced with my demons
A                  C#m  B
I clothe them and feed them
          E              B
And I'll smile, yes I'll smile
                     A       C#m    B 
As they're taking me over

      C#m                     A7
And if I cannot sleep for the secrets I keep
        B                     A
It's the prize I'm willing to steal
        E                      B                 A    
Oh, the end of the night never comes too quickly for me
And I'll smile...
                          USE SAME CHORD SEQUENCE FOR REST OF SONG.
    E                      B                 A
The end of the night never comes too quickly for me

I'll smile, smile, I'll smile as they're taking me over
I'll smile, oh...
The end of the night never comes too quickly for me
Never comes too quickly for me

END ON E
