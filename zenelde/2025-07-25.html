[Intro]
Bb A Ab G Ab A Bb
  
[Verse 1]
Bb                    Eb                      Bb
  Can I tell you something about you and your band?
                      Eb                    Bb
'Cause I'm sure you'd love to listen to my advice
                           Eb
You're always out of tune, and there's no place there for you
           Eb
Dude, do I know you?
 
Bb                             Eb                           Bb
Well, where you from with that accent? Does it let you pronounce?
                       Eb                             Bb
Are you Spanish or something? Wait, can you roll your R's?
                               Eb
You're too pink to be admired, and too punk to be desired
Bb                             Eb
Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya
 
[Chorus]
          Eb           F
Just like kids, we are late
        Dm         Eb
And our homes far away
      Eb          F
We do this, we do that
    Bb        Eb
I'm tired of waiting
Eb       F             Dm        Eb
  We are all afraid of that long road
  Eb              F         Bb
I guess it's the prettiest curse
 
[Bridge]
Bb A Ab G Ab A Bb
 
[Verse 2]
Bb                       Eb                          Bb
  To be fair, I don't know you but a friend of mine does
                    Eb                               Bb
He said you were successful 'cause your legs are nice
                          Eb
It must be so much fun to spend your daytime in the van
Bb       Eb
Ha ha ha ha
 
Bb                        Eb                         Bb
 And you will never look smart if you show that big smile
                     Eb
Better dress all in black, oh, darling you're too young
Bb                               Eb
Dude, it's been a pleasant chat, but I'm off to do my job
 Bb                                  Eb                          Bb
'Cause we have the craziest crowd, waiting for these kittens to meow
Eb
 
[Chorus]
          Eb           F
Just like kids, we are late
        Dm         Eb
And our homes far away
      Eb          F
We do this, we do that
    Bb        Eb
I'm tired of waiting
Eb       F             Dm        Eb
  We are all afraid of that long road
  Eb              F
I guess it's the sweetest
  Eb              F
I guess it's the warmest
  Eb              F        Bb A Ab G Ab A Bb
I guess it's the prettiest                curse
