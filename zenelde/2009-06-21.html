Intro:
RIFF 1 (8x)-(Guitar 1 only on 3rd & 5th-8th times)
 
Verse 1: (palm muted)
A            C               E         A
Speed kills, coming down the mountain
             C               E         A
Speed kills, coming down the street
             C               E         A
Speed kills, the presence of [minors]
                    C           E      A
Speed kills, if you know what I mean
  
RIFF 2 (2x)
 
Verse 2: (palm muted)
A              C         E             A
I got to feel, woke-up inside again
                    C           E      A
I got to feel, this broke world fixed
                 C      E              A
I got to feel, a god outside myself
                      C          E     A
I got to feel, when I touch your lips
 
Pre-chorus: (Nigel plays one of the riffs under the chords)
A             E         C      A
The things we do to the people that we love
           E                 C         A
The way we break, if there's something we can't take
            E             C       A
Destroy the world that we took so long to make
 
RIFF 2
 
Chorus:
F                  A
We expect her gone, for sometime
F                    C    G
I wish her safe from home
F                A
To find yourself, in a fallen land
F              C    G
Another refugee, outside of refugee
 
A E C A (low volume)
 
RIFF 2 (2x)
 
Verse 3:
A              C               E               A
How's it feel, she's comin' up roses
               C               E               A
How's it feel, she's comin' up sweet
                    C     E                    A
How's it feel, it's all inspite of you
                          C           E        A
How's it feel, when she's out of your reach
