Capo 2 (G=A)
 
[Verse]
G              Bm
I'm so tired of being here
G              Bm
Suppressed by all my childish fears
G
And if you have to leave
Bm
I wish that you would just leave
G
'Cause your presence still lingers here
Bm                          Em
And it won't leave me alone
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Em         Bm               Em
These wounds won't seem to heal
Bm                      Em
This pain is just too real
Bm                          D             Em
There's just too much that time cannot erase
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em          C        D         Bm
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
Em          C        D         Bm
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
Em          C        D         Bm
I held your hand through all of these years
Em          C     D
But you still have
D        G  Bm  G  Bm
All of me
 
 
[Verse]
 
G               Bm
You used to captivate me
G              Bm
By your resonating light
G              Bm
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
G
Your face it haunts
Bm
My once pleasant dreams
G
Your voice it chased away
Bm                  Em
All of the sanity in me
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Bm                         Em
These wounds won't seem to heal
Bm                    Em
This pain is just too real
Bm                          D            Em
There's just too much that time cannot erase
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em          C        D         Bm
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
Em          C        D         Bm
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
Em          C        D         Bm
I held your hand through all of these years
Em          C     D
But you still have
D         C
All of me
 
C                Em         D               C     C/B
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
Am                        Bm
But though you're still with me
C          D          Em   C  D  Bm
I've been alone all along
 
Em   C  D  Bm
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em          C        D         Bm
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
Em          C        D         Bm
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
Em          C        D         Bm
I held your hand through all of these years
Em          C     D
But you still have
D        G
All of me
 
G  Bm G Bm  G Bm G Bm G
