    G                   Em
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
    G                   Em
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
    G                   Em
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
D                              C
We don't need no water let the mother fucker burn
(mute)
Burn mother fucker burn

G5/B5 E5 x3
D5 C5

Same chord pattern throughout.  I only play power chords in the breaks
after the choruses, but I think the real version does more often.
Listen to the song, You'll figure it out.

And the lyrics (as I hear them):

Hello my name is Jimmy Pop and I'm a dumb white guy
I'm not old or new but middle school fifth grade like junior high
I don't know mo-fo ya'll beeps beep but I'm givin props to my ho
        cause she's fly  [that line I'm not too sure about]
I can take the heat cause I'm the other white meat known as kid funky
fry

I am hung like planet Pluto hard to see with the naked eye
But if I crashed into Uranus I would stick it where the sun don't shine
I'm kinda like Hans Solo always strokin my own wookie
I'm the root of all that's evil but you can call me cookie

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water let the mother fucker burn
Burn mother fucker burn

Yo yo

This hard-core ghetto ganster image takes a lot of practice
I'm not black like Barry White no I am white like Frack Black is
So if man is 5 and the devil is 6 then that must make me seven
This Honky's gone to Heaven

But If I go to Hell then I hope I burn well
I'll spend my days with JFK Marvin Gaye Martha Ray and Lawence Welk
And Kurt Cobain Kojak Mark Twain and Jimi Hendrix Poltergiest
And Webster yeah Emanual Lewis cause he's the Antichrist

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water let the mother fucker burn
Burn mother fucker burn

Everybody here we go
Ooooh ooooh come on party people
Ooooh ooooh throw your hands in the air
Ooooh ooooh come one party people
Ooooh ooooh wave 'em like ya don't care
Ooooh ooooh come on party people
Ooooh ooooh everybody say ho
Ooooh ooooh everbody here we go
