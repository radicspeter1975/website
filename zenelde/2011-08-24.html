Vs- F#, C#, Ebm, B
Ch- Ab, B

intro: F#, C#, Ebm, B X 2

Vs
  C#               Ebm   B, F#  
I heard you crying loud,
        C#         Ebm  B,  
all the way across town
            F#                 C#
You've been searching for that someone,
         Ebm           B
and it's me out on the prowl
   F#       C#               Ebm        B
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment
Sleazin' my back yard so don't get, so uptight
you been thinking about ditching me

Ch
Ab                    B
No time to search the world around
Ab                           B
Cause you know where I'll be found
            F#     C#, Ebm, B
When I come around

Vs
I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
to try and slag me down because I know you're right

So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing
was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just
not right

Ch
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around

Solo

Ch
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
