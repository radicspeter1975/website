[Verse]
        E           G#          C#m  A
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
        E           G#          C#m  A
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
    E        G#      C#m
The ocean is big and blue
A            E           G#          C#m
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you
 
[Chorus]
A           E        G#               C#m
Cars on the highway, planes in the air
A         E      G#             C#m
Everyone else is going somewhere
    A         E        G#            C#m
But I'm going nowhere, getting there soon
A          E         G#             C#m  A
I might as well just sink down with you
 
[Verse]
        E           G#             C#m  A
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
        E           G#             C#m  A
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
    E        G#          C#m
The ocean is big and blue
A            E           G#          C#m
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you
A
I just wanna
 
[Solo]
E B G A (4x)
 
[Chorus]
A          E        G#        C#m
Out on the highway, up in the air
A        E       G#        C#m
Everyone else is going somewhere
A             E           G#            C#m
They're going nowhere and I'll be there too
A          E       G#         C#m
I might as well go under with you
 
[Post-Chorus]
        E           G#          C#m  A
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
        E           G#          C#m  A
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
    E        G#      C#m
The ocean is big and blue
A            E           G#          C#m
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you
 
[Verse]
A            E           G#          C#m  A
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you
        E           G#          C#m  A
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
    E        G#      C#m
The ocean is big and blue
A            E           G#          C#m
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you
 
[Outro]
A
I just wanna
E B G A
      I just wanna
E B G A
      I just wanna
E B G A
      I just wanna
