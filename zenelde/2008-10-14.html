                Gm7
          When you're talkin to yourself
                C
          And nobody's home
          Gm7
          You can fool yourself
             C
          You came in this world alone (Alone)
          
          Bb            C
          So nobody ever told you baby
                  G
          How it was gonna be
          Bb             C
          So what'll happen to you baby
                         G
          Guess we'll have to wait and see
          Eb    Bb
            One, two
          
          Gm              F
          Old at heart but I'm only 28
            Eb
          And I'm much too young
                     G
          To let love break my heart
                        F
          Young at heart but it's getting much too late
             Eb          G
          To find ourselves so far apart
          F                    G
          I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
          F              G
          And what more could you ask from me
          F               G
          How could you say that I never needed you
          Eb             D
          When you took everything
          F              G
          Said you took everything from me
          
          Gm                  F
          Young at heart and it gets so hard to wait
               Eb                      G
          When no one I know can seem to help me now
                      F
          Old at heart but I musn't hesitate
             Eb           G
          If I'm to find my own way out
                Gm7              C
          Still talkin' to myself and nobody's home   (Alone)
          
          Bb            C
          So nobody ever told us baby
                 G
          How it was gonna be
          Bb            C
          So what'll happen to us baby
                         G
          Guess we'll have to wait and see
          
          C         G
          When I find out all the reasons
                F
          Maybe I'll find another way
                 C     G
          Find another day
                      F         C
          With all the changing seasons of my life
                  G      F     C
          Maybe I'll get it right next time
                     G
          And now that you've been broken down
                  F
          Got your head out of the clouds
                 C
          You're back down on the ground
                  G
          And you don't talk so loud
                  F
          And you don't walk so proud
              C        G    F
          Any more, and what for
          
          [SOLO]
          
          C            G
          Well I jumped into the river
                      F
          Too many times to make it home
                   C            G
          I'm out here on my own, an drifting all alone
                  F        C
          If it doesn't show give it time
                    G       F
          To read between the lines
          Am         G        F   G
          'Cause I see the storm is getting closer
          Am    G         F G
          And the waves they get so high
          Am       G            F         G
          Seems everything We've ever known's here
          Am        G          F---E-D---C-Bb---G---C
          Why must it drift away and die
          
          [SOLO]
          
          C           G
          I'll never find anyone to replace you
                   F              C         G     F
          Guess I'll have to make it thru, this time- oh this time
            C---C-G-Am
          Without you
               G             F      G
          I knew the storm was getting closer
          Am       G              F     G
          And all my friends said I was high
          Am     G        F     G
          But everything we've ever known's here
          Am    G        F     D     C
          I never wanted it to die
          
          F C
