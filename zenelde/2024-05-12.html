[Verse]
 Dm
Oh he treats me with respect
 
He says he loves me all the time
 F
He calls me 15 times a day
 
He likes to make sure that I'm fine
              Dm
You know I've never met a man who's made me feel quite so secure
              F
He's not like all them other boys
 
They're all so dumb and immature
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                  Dm
There's just one thing that's getting in the way
                 F
When we go up to bed you're just no good
 
Its such a shame
                  Dm
I look into your eyes I want to get to know you
                        F
And then you make this noise and its apparent it's all over
 
[Chorus]
Gm
It's not fair
         Bb
And I think you're really mean
     F
I think you're really mean
     C
I think you're really mean
     Gm
Oh you're supposed to care
         Bb
But you never make me scream
      C
You never make me scream
 
     Gm
Oh it's not fair
          Bb
And it's really not ok
       F
It's really not ok
       C
It's really not ok
      Gm
Oh you're supposed to care
      Bb
But all you do is take
      C
Yeah all you do is take
 
[Verse]
 Dm
Oh I lie here in the wet patch
 
In the middle of the bed
              F
I'm feeling pretty damn hard done by
 
I spent ages giving head
          Dm
Then I remember all the nice things that you ever said to me
           F
Maybe I'm just overreacting maybe you're the one for me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                 Dm
There's just one thing that's getting in the way
                 F
When we go up to bed you're just no good
 
It's such a shame
                  Dm
I look into your eyes I want to get to know you
                        F
And then you make this noise and it's apparent it's all over
 
[Chorus]
 Gm
It's not fair
         Bb
And I think you're really mean
     F
I think you're really mean
     C
I think you're really mean
      Gm
Oh you're supposed to care
         Bb
But you never make me scream
      C
You never make me scream
 
   Gm
Oh it's not fair
          Bb
And it's really not ok
       F
It's really not ok
       C
It's really not ok
      Gm
Oh you're supposed to care
      Bb
But all you do is take
      C
Yeah all you do is take
 
Dm     F     Dm      F
 
[Bridge]
                Dm
There's just one thing that's getting in the way
                 F
When we go up to bed you're just no good
 
It's such a shame
                 Dm
I look into your eyes I want to get to know you
                      F
And then you make this noise and its apparent it's all over.....(aahh!!)

Oh it's not fair
         Bb
And it's really not ok
