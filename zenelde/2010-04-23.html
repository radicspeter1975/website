( A D )
Yesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry

( A D )
Go on go on
Just walk away
Go on go on
Your choice is made

Go on go on
And disappear
Go on go on
Away from here

( Bm E ) Riff 3
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
                     A     D Riff 4 e Riff 2
Inbetween without you
           A            D
Without you

( A D )
Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside

( A D )
Come back come back
Don't walk away
Come back come back
Come back today
Come back come back
Why can't you see?
Come back come back
Come back to me

( Bm E ) Riff 3
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
                        A              D Riff 4 e Riff 2
Inbetween without you
           A            D
Without you
