(fél hanggal mélyebben G=F#)

G G/F#   Em  D
 
G                G/F#     Em              D
 Quarters on the eyes, Rejected Sacrifice.
G                G/F#  Em                  D
 Cauterized at best, Failing your litmus test.
G                   G/F#      Em             D
 I know it's dumb to say, But turnabout's fair play.
G                 G/F#      Em             D
 Always knew that you, Were suffering a fool.
 
Chorus:
C                              Em
 You go ahead, as good as dead. You go ahead, as good as dead.
C                              Am               C
 You go ahead, as good as dead. As good as dead, you can go ahead.
 
G                     Em
 Okay... I understand, But I don't want to be your friend.
G                            Em
 I don't need another friend, I've got too many friends.
G                      Em
 If I was Eddie Vedder, Would you like me any better?
G                  Em
 That's it! I quit! I don't give a shit!
 
Chorus:
C                              Em
 You go ahead, as good as dead. You go ahead, as good as dead. x7
A                 C
 Coming to a head, You're as good as dead!
