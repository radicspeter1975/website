Hey baby wake up from your a sleep
We have arrived onto the future
And the whole world is become....

Elektronik, Supersonik
Supersonik, Elektronik

Hey baby ride with me away
We doesn't have much time
My blue jeans is tight
So onto my love rocket, climb
Inside tank of fuel is not fuel, but love
Above us, there is nothing above
But the stars, above

All systems gone!
Prepare for downcount!

5....4....3....1! Off blast!

Fly away, my space rocket
You no need put money in my pocket
The door is closed I just lock it
(Ha) I put my (Ha) spark plug in your socket (Ha Ha Ha)

The sun is sky is bright like fire
You and me get higher and higher
Cutting communication wire
Only thing can stop us is flat tire

(Ha, Ha, Ha Ha Ha Ha)

Hey love crusader
I want to be your space invader
For you I will dsecend the deepest moon crater
I is more stronger than Darth Vapour
Obey me, I is your new dictator
For you is Venus, I am Mars
With you I is more richer than all the czars
Make a wishes on a shooting stars
Then for you I will play on my cosmic guitars!

Ladies and Gentlemen
Fasten your beltseats
We has commenced our decent
I trust you enjoy this flight
As much as you enjoy this accent

Now back on Earth its time for downsplash
Into sea of eternal glory my spaceship crash
People have arrived for cheer me from near and far
And as I float I open door and shout
"I is worlds biggest, washed-up superstar!"

(Supersonik, Elektronik)

As for sure as the sun rises in the west
All the seas and all the boats I am the bestest
Come, let me put ring of Jupiter on your finger
Then like a smell around you I will forever linger
Ok, is time for end, no more will I sang
Let me take you back in time
I want for you to experience big bang

Long live space race
Long live, Molvania
