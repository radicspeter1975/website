C                     Em
You can shake it all around
C                    Em
You can go up and down
C                   Em
You can lose what you found
D                    Am
But you can't ignore my techno

Cm                 Em
You can go west or east
Cm                 Em
Confess your sins to a priest
Cm                 Em
You can slay the wicked beast
D                  Am
But you can't ignore my techno

Instrumental: G, A, Em, Bm, C (will explain rhythm at the chorus)

C                     Em
You can go to the doctor
C                     Em
You can cough in his face
C                     Em
Infect the whole human race
D                     Am
But you can't ignore my techno

C                     Em
You can laugh you can cry
C                     Em
You can live you can die
C                     Em
Spend your days asking why?
D                      Am
But you can't ignore my techno

G                     A
You can trip on my synthesizer

Electronic world for every boy and every girl

G                     A
You can trip on my synthesizer
Em                        Bm            C
In the end technology onto the world that set us free

Instrumental: C5, A5, E5   do this four times (just listen to the song)

Same as other verses:

Be all that you can be
Just as long as you are free
You were blind and now you see
That just is my techno

Same as Chorus:

You can trip on my synthesizer
Electronic world for every boy and every girl
You can trip on my synthesizer
In the end technology onto the world that set us free

You can trip on my
You can trip on my
You can trip on my
You can trip
You can trip
You can trip on my synthesizer
You can trip on my synthesizer
Let's go
