1. Fm
 I hope you´re feeling happy now,
                   Eb/G                  Eb
 I see you feel no pain at all it seems.
                      Fm
 I wonder what you´re doin´now
                 Eb/G                Eb
 I wonder if you think of me at all.
                       Fm
 Do you still play the same moves now
                      Eb/G                    Eb
 or are those special moods for someone else?

 I hope you´re feeling happy now.

Refrain:
                  Eb       Bb                 Fm        Ab
 Just because you feel good, doesn´t make you right, oh no.
                  Eb       Bb               Fm          Ab
 Just because you feel good, still want you here tonight.

2. Fm
 Does laughter still discover you?
                       Eb/G                      Eb
 I see through all the smiles that look so right.
                       Fm
 Do you still have the same friends now
                    Eb/G                  Eb
 to smoke away your problems in your life?
                 Fm
 Oh how do you remember me,
                       Eb/G                  Eb
 the one that made you laugh until you cried?
                       Fm         Eb
 I hope you´re feeling happy now.
