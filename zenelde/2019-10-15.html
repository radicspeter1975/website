[Intro] (Clean guitar)
E-B-F#

[Verse 1]
E         B                     F#
Lightning crashes...a new mother cries...
E      B                     F#
Her placenta falls to the floor...
E    B              F#
The angel opens her eyes...
                   E
The confusion sets in...
          B                         F#
Before the doctor can even close the door...

E          B                       F#
Lightning crashes...an old mother dies...
E       B                   F#
Her intentions fall to the floor...
E    B                F#
The angel closes her eyes...
                           E
The confusion that was hers...
          B                       F#
Belongs now to the baby down the hall...

[Chorus]
        E      B          F#
        Oh now feel it coming back again...
             E         B      F#
        Like a rolling thunder chasing the wind...
             E        B               F#
        Forces pulling from the center of the Earth again...
             E      B        F#
        I can feel it...

[Verse 2]
E         B                    F#
Lightning crashes...a new mother cries...
E     B                        F#
This moment she's been waiting for...
E    B               F#
The angel opens her eyes...
                       E
Pale blue colored eyes...
              B                               F#
Presents the circle and puts the glory out to hide, hide...

[Chorus]
        E       B         F#
        Oh now feel it coming back again...
             E         B      F#
        Like a rolling thunder chasing the wind...
             E        B               F#
        Forces pulling from the center of the Earth again...
             E      B        F#
        I can feel it...
             E      B        F#
        I can feel it...

[Solo]
(G#m-F#) (E-F#) Oh I...

[Chorus] (Quietly)
        E       B          F#
        Oh now feel it coming back again...
             E         B      F#
        Like a rolling thunder chasing the wind...
             E        B               F#
        Forces pulling from the center of the Earth again...
             E      B        F#
        I can feel it...
      
        (Loudly)
        E       B          F#
        Oh now feel it coming back again...
             E         B      F#
        Like a rolling thunder chasing the wind...
             E        B               F#
        Forces pulling from the center of the Earth again...
             E      B        F#
        I can feel it...
             E      B        F#
        I can feel it...
