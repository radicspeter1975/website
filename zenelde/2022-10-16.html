Capo 1st fret. (F=F#)
 
[Verse 1]
            F               G             A
You in the dark, You in the pain, You on the run
         F                 G               A
Living a hell, Living your ghost, Living your end
F                        G              A
Never seem to get in the place that I belong
             F             G                A
Don't wanna lose the time, Lose the time to come
 
[Chorus]
 
F                G
  Whatever you say it's alright
F                G
  Whatever you do it's all good
F              G           A
  Whatever you say it's alright
C                    E
Silence is not the way
G           Am
We need to talk about it
C                    E
If heaven is on the way
C                    E
If heaven is on the way
 
[Interlude]
F   G     A   (x2)
 
[Verse 2]
           F             G               A
You in the sea, On a decline, Breaking the waves
             F             G             A
Watching the lights go down, Letting the cables sleep
 
[Chorus]
F              G
  Whatever you say it's alright
F              G
  Whatever you do it's all good
F              G           A
  Whatever you say it's alright
C                   E
Silence is not the way
G          Am
We need to talk about it
C                    E
If heaven is on the way
G              Am
We'll wrap the world around it
C                    E
If heaven is on the way
C                    E
If heaven is on the way
 
[Bridge]
C                      Am    G   E
I'm a stranger in this town.      
C                      Am    G   E
I'm a stranger in this town.      
C                      Am    G   E
I'm a stranger in this town.      
 
C                    E
If heaven is on the way
C                    E
If heaven is on the way
 
C                      Am    G   E
I'm a stranger in this town.      
C                      Am    G   E
I'm a stranger in this town.      
 
[Outro]
C    Am   G   E
