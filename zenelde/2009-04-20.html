G         D                   F              C
I am the girl you know can't look you in the eye
I am the girl you know so sick I cannot try
I am the one you want can't look you in the eye
I am the girl you know I lie and lie and lie

G    A     B      E    D    C
I'm Miss World - somebody kill me
kill me pills - no one cares, my friend - my friend
I'm Miss World - watch me break and
watch me burn - no one is listening, my friend - yeah

  G         A          B           E       D       C
I made my bed I'll lie in it - I made my bed I'll die in it
I made my bed I'll lie in it - I made my bed I'll die in it

G     A      B      E    D    C
Kill girls watch - I eat ether
Suck me under - maybe forever, my friend - yeah

  G         A          B           E       D       C
I made my bed I'll die in it - I made my bed I'll cry in it
I made my bed I'll lie in it - I made my bed I'll cry in it
I made my bed I'll die in it - I made my bed I'll lie in it, my friend

G         D                   F              C
I am the girl you know can't look you in the eye
