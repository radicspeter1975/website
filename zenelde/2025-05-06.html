[Intro]
B  F#m  E
B  F#m  E
 
[Verse 1]
B                       F#m
Run and tell all of the angels
E
This could take all night
B                       F#m
Think I need a devil to help me get things
E
right
B                      F#m
Hook me up a new revolution
       E
'Cause this one is a lie
   B                        F#m
We sat around laughing and watched the last
     E
one die
 
[Chorus]
    B                      F#m
I'm looking to the sky to save me
E
Looking for a sign of life
B                         F#m
Looking for something to help me burn out
 E
bright
    B                    F#m
I'm looking for a complication
E
Looking 'cause I'm tired of lying
G                  A
Make my way back home
                  B
When I learn to fly
  
[Instrumental]
(B) F#m  E
 B  F#m  E
  
[Verse 2]
  B                           F#m
I think I'm done nursing the patience
E
It can wait one night
    B                        F#m               E
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
B                  F#m               E
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
B                            F#m           E
Run and tell the angels that everything's alright
 
[Chorus]
    B                      F#m
I'm looking to the sky to save me
E
Looking for a sign of life
B                         F#m
Looking for something to help me burn out
 E
bright
    B                    F#m
I'm looking for a complication
E
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
G                  A
Make my way back home
                  E
When I learn to fly
G                  A
Make my way back home
 
When I learn to...
 
[Bridge]
B     G
Fly along with me
    D                   E
I can't quite make it alone
G                 A
Try to make this life my own
 
B     G
Fly along with me
    D                   E
I can't quite make it alone
G                 A
Try to make this life my own
