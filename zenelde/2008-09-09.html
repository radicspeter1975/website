E---- C----- G And the sky was made of amethyst
E---- C----- G And all the stars look just like little fish
E---- C----- G You should learn when to go
E---- C----- G You should learn how to say no

Em---- F---- G Might last a day yeah
Em---- F---- G Mine is forever
Em---- F---- G Might last a day, yeah
Em---- F---- G Well mine is forever

When they get what they want they never want it again
----------E-------------C---------D-------------A  
When they get what they want they never want it again

E-----------C---------D----------------A 
Go on, take everything, take everything I want you to
E-----------C---------D----------------A 
Go on, take everything take everything I want you to

And the sky was all violet I want it again, 
But more violet, more violet
Hey, I'm the one with no soul
One above and one (two) below

Go on, take everything take everything I want you to
Go on, take everything take everything I want you to

--E-----------------C----------D--------------A
I told you from the start just how this would end
-------E----------C------D-------------A
When I get what I want I never want it again

Go on, take everything take everything I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything I want you to
Go on take everything take everything take everything take everything
