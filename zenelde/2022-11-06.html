[Verse 1]
F#m                        C#                    Fm
Rose said quote: "it's time to make a mess" 
 
F#m                       C#                    Fm
Time won't be soon mine in time I guess 
F#m                       C#                    Fm
She's painting on my back a beautiful flowerpot 
F#m                       C#                    Fm
And she treats me she treats me she treats me like her local god 
 
[Verse 2]
F#m                       C#                    Fm
Rose said quote: "it's time to make a mess" 
F#m                       C#                    Fm
This one's yours and yours is self obsessed 
F#m                       C#                    Fm
She's painting on my back a green tom, the Beefheart one
F#m                       C#                    Fm
And she cuddles and she coos and she cuts the bullshit I confessed 
 
[Bridge]
                 F#                   F
She said: "Don't look my way 
                     F#         F
What can I possibly say 
                   F#            F    Bb     A     Bb
I've never seen you before today 
 
[Verse 3]
F#             F                             F#             F
I'm just the one that makes you think of the one 
                          F#                        F
that makes you feel like you're the one." 
 
[Chorus]
F#m                   C#                   Fm
But thank you for the roses for the roses 
F#m                       C#                    Fm
So thank you for the roses for the roses 
F#m                       C#                    Fm
Thank you for the roses for the roses (2 times)
