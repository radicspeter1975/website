When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in.

Am
When I try to get through

 On the telephone to you

There'll be nobody home.

And the inevitable pinhole burns
F                                         C      F
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt.

I've got nicotine stains on my fingers.

I've got wild staring eyes.

But I got nowhere to fly to.
Am         C                              D Fm6
Ooooh, Babe when I pick up the phone
                     C      F    C    F
There's still nobody home.
           C
I've got a pair of Gohills boots

And I got fading roots.
