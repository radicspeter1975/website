(intro)
(A5)-B5-
[E5][B5]-C#5-[D5]-C#5-D5-D#5-[A5]-G#5-A5-B5

(verse 1)
[E5]            [B5]              [D5]               [A5]
I'm seeing this girl and she just might be out of her mind,
[E5]           [B5]            [D5]              [A5]
Well she's got baggage and its all the emotional kind,
[E5]            [B5]            [D5]        [A5]
She talks about closure and that validation bit,
[E5]                 [B5]            [D5]             [A5]
I don't mean to be insensitive but I really hate that shit,

(chorus)
[E5]    [B5]       [D5]                     [A5]
Oh...   Oh...   Oh man she's got issues and I'm gonna pay,
[E5]    [B5]        [D5]                    [A5]
Oh...   Oh...   She thinks she's the victim, yeah, 

(verse 2)
[E5]              [B5]            [D5]                [A5]
Now I know she'll feel abandoned if I don't stay over late,
[E5]           [B5]                    [D5]            [A5]
& I know shes afraid to commit but its only our second date,

(chorus)
[E5]    [B5]       [D5]                     [A5]
Oh...   Oh...   Oh man she's got issues and I'm gonna pay,
[E5]    [B5]        [D5]                        [A5]
Oh...   Oh...   She thinks she's the victim,but she takes it
          [C5]
all out on me, 

(bridge 1)
[C5]                    [G5]
I don't know why you're messed up,
[A5]                  [E5]
I don't know why your whole life is a chore,
[C5]        [G5]
Just do me a favour
[A5]           [B5]           [E5]
And check your baggage at the door, 

(solo)
[E5][B5][D5][A5] x3

(verse 3)
[E5]           [B5]           [D5]              [A5]
Now she talks about her ex nonstop, but I don't mind,
[E5]                       [B5]              [D5]     
But when she calls out his name in bed thats where I draw
    [A5]  
the line
[E5]         [B5]                   [D5]                [A5]
You told me ahundred times how your father left and hes gone
[E5]            [B5]              [D5]               [A5]
But I wish you wouldnt call me daddy,when we're gettin it on

(chorus)
[E5]    [B5]       [D5]                     [A5]
Oh...   Oh...   Oh man she's got issues and I'm gonna pay,
[E5]    [B5]        [D5]                   [A5]
Oh...   Oh...   She playing the victim and taking it
          [A5]
all out on me,
[E5]    [B5]       [D5]                     [A5]
Oh...   Oh...   My God she's got issues and I'm gonna pay

gonna pay,
gonna pay,
gonna pay,
gonna pay,
gonna paaay, woah, yeah, 

(bridge 2)
[C5]                [G5]
If you think I'm controlling,
[A5]        [E5]
Then why do follow me around,
[C5]               [G5]
If you're not co-dependent,
[A5]           [E5]
Why do you let others drag you down,

(bridge 1)
[C5]                    [G5]
I don't know why you're messed up,
[A5]            [E5]
I don't why your whole life is a chore,
[C5]         [G5]
Just do me a favour,
[A5]           [B5]           [E5]
And check your baggage at the door.

(end on E5)
