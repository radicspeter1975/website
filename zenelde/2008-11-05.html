<pre>
You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch people's heads a'roll
A'roll

CHORUS
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Of destruction

Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes

CHORUS

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall

CHORUS
