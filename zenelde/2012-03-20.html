    I want your mother - so what?!
    I want your sister - so what?!
    I want your brother - so what?!
    I want your system - so what?!
    I want your luck - so what?!
    I want your will - so what?
    I want your way - so what!
    I want you you you you you you you you!
    
    So what has been good to me?!
    So what has been good to me?!
    So what has been good to me?!
    So what has been good to me?!
    
    I want your boredom - so what?!
    I want your honour - so what?!
    I want your money - so what?!
    I want your secrets - so what?!
    I want your high! - so what!
    I want your low - so what?
    I want you you you you you you you you!
    
    So what has been good to me?!
    
    I have no faith in the world
    But a grim duty to see it...
    I want your help!
    I want you you you you you you you you!
    
    So what has been good to me?!
