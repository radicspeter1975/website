    [Intro]
    Amaj7   Dmaj7   Amaj7   Dmaj7
     
    [Verse 1]
    Amaj7              Dmaj7
    We never chose to part
                   Amaj7   Dmaj7
    In this stupid play
        Amaj7            Dmaj7
    And I never felt by heart
                   Bm
    That I could behave
                E           Amaj7   Dmaj7
    The way the roles were made
     
    [Verse 2]
      Amaj7                    Dmaj7
    I know that I've done you wrong
                       Amaj7
    But you're hard to please
                        Dmaj7
    When your faith is gone
                         Bm
    And when you can't believe
              E         A   E D  E
    I'm on my hands and knees
     
    [Pre-Chorus]
        A           D     E
    The junk of the hearts
        A    E      D      E
    The junk of the hearts
     
    [Chorus]
        A           D    E
    The junk of the hearts
             F#m     Bm  E
    It's the junk of the hearts
        A           D    E
    The junk of the hearts
             F#m     Bm  E    A   Dmaj7   Amaj7   Dmaj7
    It's the junk of the hearts
     
    [Verse 2]
    A                  D
    I've given all of me
                      A    D
    And you crave for more
    A                        D
    Weird how this makes us feel
        Bm
    Insecure
                E           A E D  E
    That's what friends are for
     
    [Pre-Chorus]
        A           D     E
    The junk of the hearts
        A    E      D      E
    The junk of the hearts
     
    [Chorus]
        A           D    E
    The junk of the hearts
             A           D      E
    It's the junk of the hearts
        A    E      D    E
    The junk of the hearts
             A    E      D      E
    It's the junk of the hearts
          
    [Outro]
        A    E      D      E
    The junk of the hearts
        A    E      D      E
    The junk of the hearts
        A    E      D      E
    The junk of the hearts
             F#m         E   A
    It's the junk of the hearts
    D   A   D   A
