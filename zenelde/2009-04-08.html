intro: 
G//Am//C/F/G//

Em              Am
 Oh mom, the dreams are not so bad
        A                                   Am
 It's just that there's so much to do
                        Em   Emadd6  Em
 And I'm tired of sleeping

Em              Am
 Oh mom, the old man is telling me something
        A                    Am
 his eyes are wide and his mouth is thin
      Em         Emadd6         Em
 And I just can't hear what he's saying

G            Am
 Oh mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
        C                                    F
 It's just that there's so much to do
                        G  Gsus2 G
 And I'm tired of sleeping
G          Am
 Oh mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
        C                                    F
 It's just that there's so much to do
                        G Gsus2 G
 And I'm tired of sleeping

Em              Am
 Oh mom, the kids are playing in pennies
          A                             Am
 They're up to their knees in money
                          Em   Emadd6  Em
 In the dirt of the churchyard steps

Em              Am
 Oh mom, that man he ripped out his lining
A                               Am
 Tore out a piece of his body
                   Em   Emadd6  Em
 To show us his "clean quilted heart"

Em              Am
 Oh mom, the bird on the string is hanging
        A                           Am
 Her bones are twisting and dancing
                         Em  Emadd6 Em
 She's fighting for her small life
