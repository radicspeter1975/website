Freak out, give in doesn't matter what you believe in.
Stay cool, and be somebody's fool this year.
Cause they know who is righteous what is hold.

Bridge
: So I'm told,
Who wants honey as long as there's some money ?
Who wants that honey ?

Steers, unite come align for the big fight to rock. (for you.)
Beware all those angels with their wings glued on.
Deep down they are frightened and they're scared.

Bridge : 
If you don't stare,
Who wants honey as long as there's some money ?
Who wants that honey ?

Chorus :
Yeah, let me out !! (x4)+ Solo

Interlude : 
Tell me all of your secrets
Cannot help but believe this is true.
Tell me all of your secrets.
I know, I know, I know should have listened to what I was told.
Who wants that honey as long as there's some money ?
Who wants that honey ?

Chorus : Let me out. (x4)
