Intro: D, B

Verse I:
D                          B
Tought I ran into you down on the street
D                         B
Then it turned out to only be a dream

Chorus:
G        D                 F#              B (v. bm)  A
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
G         D               F#              B (bm?)   A 
She went away and then I took a different path
G       D                  F#               B (bm?)  A
I remember the face but I can't recall the name
G                A
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been

     D            B

Verse II (same chords):

Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she every marry old what's his face

Chorus

Bridge: G, D, F#, B, A 

G         D 
Remember, whatever,
F#               B     A
It seems like forever ago,
G           D
Remember, whatever,
F#               B     A
It seems like forever ago,
G          D 
The regrets are useless,
F#
In my mind,
              B
She's in my head,
   A
I must confess,
G          D
The regrets are useless,
    F#
In my mind
             B
She's in my head,
   A
From so long ago

G         D          F#           B A
Go.. go.. go... go.. Go.. go            x2

End:
G            A
And in the darkest night,
G           A
If my memory serves me right,
G           A
I'll never turn back time
G                 A
Forgetting you but not the time
