Little field mice
Living under the house
Never eating much
Tough life for a mouse
And if you think you're
Gonna be spared
You're wrong

Field mice, head lice
Spiders in the kitchen
Don't think twice 'bout
Whatever keeps you itchin'
Ice water, flyswatter
Gonna get you through
The day

Heat is rolling in like
Hell's red rug
Stinking like the
Breath of Beelzebub
And if you think you won't
Walk on coals
You will

Field mice, head lice
Spiders in the kitchen
Don't think twice 'bout
Whatever keeps you itchin'
Ice water, flyswatter
Gonna get you through
The day
The day

Field mice, head lice
Spiders in the kitchen
Don't think twice 'bout
Whatever keeps you itchin'
Ice water, flyswatter
Gonna get you through
The day

That's real good
Oh yeah
