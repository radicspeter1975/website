[Intro]
B 
 
[Verse 1 Mark Hoppus]
B                            F#                         E 
Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
B                       C#m             E 
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
B                     F#                 EE 
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
B                                 C#m                E 
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because
            B 
Yeah, just because
B 

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
B                         F#      E 
And my girlfriend likes UL and DHC
             B                C#m        E 
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
B                    F#               E 
Quite half as much as I know I need her
B                    C#m         E 
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
F#                          E                     B 
And when I feel like giving up, like my world is falling down
F#                         C#m   
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation
      E 
And I see her pretty face, it takes me away to a better place, and

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge + Mark Hoppus]
B                   
I know that everything
F# 
Know that everything
E 
Know that everything
G#m           F# 
Everything's gonna be fine
B 
I know that everything
F# 
Know that everything
E 
Know that everything
G#m           F#         B 
Everything's gonna be fine

[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus]
                 B            F#                     E 
Yeah, my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
        B                C#m            E 
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge
    B                    F#              E 
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
    B                             C#m               E 
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
     F#                     E                           B 
And when I feel like giving up like my world is falling down
     F#                     C#m 
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation
      E 
And I see her pretty face, it takes me away to a better place, and

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge + Mark Hoppus]
B 
I know that everything
F# 
Know that everything
E 
Know that everything
G#m            F#           B
Everything's gonna be fine
