verse 1
                  B      C#m    A                   B     C#m     E
we used to leave the blue lights on and there was a beat
                 B      C#m   A                  B    C#m    E 
ever since you have been gone it’s all caffeine-free, faux punk fatigues
              B     C#m     A
said it all before
                       B      C#m       E
they try to kick it, their feet fall asleep
             B      C#m       A
yet no harm done no
B           C#m            E
none of them want to fight me

chorus
E    B      C#m     B     E
combat baby come back baby
    G#m        C#m 
fight off the lethargy
    B     E
don’t go quietly
   G#m     C#m
combat baby
        B            E
said you would never give up easy
      G#m     C#m
combat baby come back

verse 2 (same chords as first)
get back in town I wanna paint it black
I wanna get around
easy living crowd so flat
said it all before
they try to kick it, their feet fall asleep
I want to be wrong but
B               C#m      A           E            
No one here wants to fight me like you do

chorus
combat baby come back baby
fight off the lethargy
don’t go quietly
combat baby
said you were never gonna give up easy
combat baby come back

bridge:
C#m       A
I try to be so nice
   Bb diminshed
Compromise
       A
Who gets it good?
     C#m                     A
Every mighty mild seventies child
Bb diminished                  A
Every mighty mild seventies child
E
Beats me

E          B      C#m             B   E
Do do doo do do doo do do doo doo do doo(x2)

(chords same as chorus)
Combat baby come back baby
Combat baby come back
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye baby
Combat baby come back

B     C#m       A
how I miss your ranting
B       C#m         E
do you miss my all time lows
