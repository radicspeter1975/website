 G       F         G         F
You can look, but you can't touch
I don't think I like you much
Heaven knows what a girl can do
Heaven knows what you've got to prove

Chorus:
             G      F D# C
I think I'm paranoid
and complicated
I think I'm paranoid
Manipulated

D# Cm

Bridge:
 Bb
Bend me, break me
F
Anyway you need me
Bb              Dm
All I want is you
Bend me, break me
Breaking part is easy
               D
All I want is you
I fall down just to give you thrill
Prop me up with another pill
If I should fail, if I should fold
I amp my faith to the sticking pole

Chorus:
I think I'm paranoid
Manipulated
I think I'm paranoid
Too complicated

Bridge.

I think I'm paranoid...I think I'm paranoid 

Bridge.

  G        F
Steal me, deal me
D#m               G F D#m
Anyway you heal me
Lend me, take me 
You can never change me
Love me, like me
Go ahead and fight me
Please me, tease me
Go ahead and leave me

 G         F
Bend me, break me             }
Anyway you need me            }
