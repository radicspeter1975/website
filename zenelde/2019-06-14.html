fél hanggal mélyebben (E=Eb)
[Intro]
Emaj7   E   A       Emaj7   E

[Verse 1]
A                          Emaj7   E
  Shakedown nineteen seven nine,
A                          Emaj7   E
  Cool kids never have the time.
    A                            F#m7
On a live wire right up off the street
        B        Emaj7   E
You and I should meet.

[Verse 2]
A                         Emaj7   E
  Junebug skipping like a stone
A                                Emaj7   E
  With headlights pointed at the dawn.
A
  We were sure we'd never see
   F#m7      B
An end to it all.

[Chorus 1]
    E       Emaj7 Amaj7                      E
And I don't even  care to shake these zipper blues,
    Emaj7    Amaj7                          E
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
   Emaj7  Amaj7
To dust I guess
                F#m7            B       Emaj7   E
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below.

A       Emaj7   E

[Verse 3]
A                                 Emaj7   E
  Double cross the vacant and the bored,
A                                       Emaj7   E
  They're not sure just what we have in store.
A                        F#m7         A
  Morphine city slippin' dues down to see:

[Chorus 2]
     E        Emaj7 Amaj7                  E
That we don't even  care as restless as we are,
   Emaj7    Amaj7                          E
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts.
    Emaj7    Amaj7
And poured cement,
               B
Lamented and assured.

[Bridge]
                  C#m     A
To the lights and towns below,
B               C#m      A
Faster than the speed of sound,
B              C#m          A    F#m7      B        Emaj7   E
Faster than we thought we'd go beneath the sound of hope.

[Verse 4]
A                        Emaj7   E
  Justine never knew the rules,
A                               Emaj7   E
  Hung down with the freaks and ghouls.
    A                      Emaj7   E
No a-pologies ever need be made,
A                            F#m7       B
  I know you better than you fake it to see:

[Chorus 3]
     E        Emaj7 Amaj7                      E
That we don't even  care to shake these zipper blues,
    Emaj7    Amaj7                          E
And we don't know just where out bones will rest
   Emaj7  Amaj7
To dust I guess,
                F#m             B       Emaj7   E
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below.

[Outro]
A                                 Emaj7   E
  The street heats the urgency of now.
A                            E
  As you see there's no one around.
