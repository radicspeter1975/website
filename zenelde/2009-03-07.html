Capo on 1st (C=C#)
[I. Jesus of Suburbia]
[Verse 1]

C
I'm the son of rage and love
Am
The Jesus of Suburbia                           
F
From the Bible of none of the above
G
On a steady diet of 

C
Soda pop and Ritalin
Am
No one ever died for my 
F
Sins in hell, as far as I can tell                              
G
At least the ones I've gotten away with

[Chorus 1]

F                              G
And there's nothing wrong with me
F                           G
This is how I'm supposed to be  
F                 G             
In a land of make believe

That don't believe in me

[Instrumental]
 C   G   F       (x2)

[Verse 2] 
C
Get my television fix
Am 
Sitting on my crucifix
F                               
The living room or my private womb
G
While the moms and brads are away

C
To fall in love and fall in debt
Am
To alcohol and cigarettes                       
F
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
G
And doing someone else's cocaine

[Chorus 1]
F                              G
And there's nothing wrong with me
F                           G
This is how I'm supposed to be  
F                 G             
In a land of make believe

That don't believe in me

[Instrumental]
C   G   F       (x2)
C   Am   F   G  
C   E   Am   G   F   G  

[II. City of the Damned]
[Verse 3]
  
C
At the center of the earth
C/B
In the parking lot                              
Am               G
Of the 7 11 were I was taught
F                    G
The motto was just a lie

C
It says home is were your heart is
C/B
But what a shame
Am                              G
Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
F                    G
We're beating out of time

[Chorus 2]
Am      G
City of the dead
C             F
At the end of another lost highway
Am      G          F
Sign misleading to nowhere                      
Am      G
City of the damned
C                  F
Lost children with dirty faces today
Am     G               F
No one really seems to care

[Verse 4]
C
I read the graffiti
C/B
In the bathroom stall                           
Am                            G
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
F                   G
And so it seemed to confess

C
It didn't say much
C/B
But it only confirmed that                      
Am                             G
The center of the earth is the end of the world
F                       G
And I could really care less

[Chorus 2]
Am      G
City of the dead
C             F
At the end of another lost highway
Am      G          F
Sign misleading to nowhere                      
Am      G
City of the damned
C                  F
Lost children with dirty faces today
Am     G               F
No one really seems to care

[Verse 5]
C                      G#   G
Everyone is so full of shit
C                      G#   G
Born and raised by hypocrites
C                         G#   G  
Hearts recycled but never saved
C                      G#   G
From the cradle to the grave    
C                          G#   G
We are the kids of war and peace
C                          G#   G
From Anaheim to the Middle East
C                           G#   G
We are the stories and disciples
C                    G#   G
Of the Jesus of Suburbia

F            G     C   G
Land of make believe
F            G          C   G
And it don't believe in me              
F            G    C   G
Land of make believe
F            G
And I don't believe

[Chorus 3]
    F   G   C
And I don’t care (x4)
    F   G   C   G
And I don’t care

[IV. Dearly Beloved]
[Verse 6]
G                      Bm
Dearly beloved are you listening?
C                       G             D
I can’t remember a word that you were saying
G                      Bm
Are we demented or are we disturbed?
C                           G          D
The space that's in between insane and insecure

G                          Bm
Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
C                   G          D
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed
G                      Bm
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
C                              G              D
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

[Instrumental]

To the light of masochist
