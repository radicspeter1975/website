E / F# / C#m / B /

E                                                 F#
Now his intentions unfold, they're not what they seem,
C#m                      B
He only wants to take control.
E                                           F#
Boy is he selling you loads, all you do is believe,
C#m                         B
Grant him his black-eyed fantasy.
G#7                A                     F#             B
He claims that he knows you, says it's written in the stars,
G#7                    A
Do you believe this bullshit?
         C                            D                        E
Tell me you don't want to face this situation any more than I do.
E                                                F#
Oh you think you're so great, keep it up at this rate,
C#m                              B
You're bound to catch it if you wait.
E                                                  F#
I've seen the symptoms before, they come as they please,
C#m                           B
Here comes the low rent man again,
G#                  A                      F#           B
He claims that he knows you, says it's written in the stars,
G#                      A
Will you believe this bullshit?
           C                            D
Tell me you don't want to face this situation any more than
E
I do.

Solo: G / A / Em / D 

G                                                   A
So what does he have in store; does he need you to bleed?
Em                       D
Inadequate in all he breathes,
B                 C                      A             D
He claims that he knows you, says it's written in the stars,
B                       C
Will you believe this bullshit?
    Eb                           F                      G
If you don't want to face this situation any more then I don't.
