am
Party girls don't get hurt

Can't feel anything, when will I learn
G                        Em 
I push it down, push it do--own

Am
I'm the one "for a good time call"
        F
Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
  G                        Em
I feel the love, feel the lo--ove

F
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
Am
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
G
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink

Throw em back, till I lose count

F         G              Em
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier,
         F
from the chandelier
F         G                  Em
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
        F
Like it doesn't exist
F         G          Em
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night,
        F
feel my tears as they dry
F         G              Em
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier,
         F
from the chandelier

                   F
And I'm holding on for dear life,
                      G
won't look down won't open my eyes
                   Em
Keep my glass full until morning light,
                        F
'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
                     F
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
                      G
won't look down won't open my eyes
                   Em
Keep my glass full until morning light,
                        F
'cause I'm just holding on for tonight (On for tonight)

Am
Sun is up, I'm a mess
      F
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
     G                                 Em
Here comes the shame, here comes the sha--ame
