C5 
She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at St. Martin's college, that's where I
G5 
Caught her eye
C5 
She told me that her dad was loaded
I said, "in that case I'll have a rum and coca cola," she said fine
G5 
And then in thirty seconds time, she said:

F5 
I wanna live like common people
I wanna do whatever common people do
C5 
I wanna sleep with common people
I wanna sleep with common people, like you
G5 
Well what else could I do?
I said "I'll see what I can do."

VERSE 2

C5 
I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why, but I had to start it somewhere
G5 
So it started there.
C5 
I said, "pretend you've got no money."
She just laughed and said "oh, you're so funny"
G5 
I said "Yeah, well I can't see anyone else smiling in here."

Are you sure?

F5 
You wanna live like common people?
You wanna see whatever common people see?
C5 
You wanna sleep with common people...
You wanna sleep with common people, like me?
G5 
But she didn't understand...
She just smiled and held my hand!

CHORUS

C5 
Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
G5 
Smoke some fags and play some pool,
Pretend you never went to school
C5 
But still you'll never get it right
'Cus when you're layed in bed at night
G5 
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all, yeah

F5 
You'll never live like common people
You'll never see whatever common people see
C5 
Never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
G5 
And then dance and drink and screw
Because there's nothing else to do!

BRIDGE

C5  G5 
C5  G5 

VERSE 3

F5 
Sing along with the common people
Sing along and it might just get you through
C5 
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you
G5 
And the stupid things that you do
Because you think that poor's cool

<i>(BREAKDOWN
C5 
Like a dog lying in the corner
They will bite you and never warn you
G5 
Look out, they'll tear your insides out
C5 
Cus everybody hates a tourist
Especially one of those who thinks it's all such a laugh
G5 
And the chip stains and grease
Will come out in the bath

VERSE 4

F5 
You will NEVER understand
How it feels to live your life
C5 
With no meaning or control
And with nowhere left to go
G5 
You are amazed that they exist
And they burn so bright that you can only wonder why)</i>

CHORUS

C5 
Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
G5 
Smoke some fags and play some pool,
Pretend you never went to school
C5 
But still you'll never get it right
'Cus when you're layed in bed at night
G5 
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all, yeah

F5 
You'll never live like common people
Never do what common people do
C5 
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life, slide out of view
G5 
And dance and drink and screw, 'cus there's nothing else to do

C5 
I wanna live with common people like you (repeat til end)
