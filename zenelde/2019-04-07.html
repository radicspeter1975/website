A          E              F#m  C#
It doesn't matter what I say
D          A              D   E
So long as I sing with inflection
A          E              F#m       C#
That makes you feel that I'll convey
D          A                D   E
Some inner truth of  vast reflection

A                E        F#m  C#
But I've said nothing so far
D          A              D   E
And I can keep it up as long as it takes
A          E                 F#m  C#
And it don't matter who you are
D          A                D                E
If I'm doing my job, it's your resolve that breaks

            A    E           F#m  C#
Because the hook brings you back
D          A            D   E
I ain't tellin' you no lie
     A      E        F#m  C#
The hook brings you back
D    A           D   E
On that you can rely

A          E              F#m  C#
There is something amiss
D          A            D   E
I am being insincere
     A      E        F#m  C#
In fact I don't mean any of this
D    A           D   E
Still my confession draws you near

A          E              F#m  C#
To confuse the issue I refer
D          A            D   E
To familiar heroes from long ago

     A      E        F#m  C#
No matter how much Peter loved her
D          A            D   E
What made the Pan refuse to grow?

[REFRÃO]
            A    E           F#m  C#
Because the hook brings you back
D          A            D   E
I ain't tellin' you no lie
     A      E        F#m  C#
The hook brings you back
D    A           D   E
On that you can rely

   A
Suck it in suck it in suck it in
          E                         F#m
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
                                      C#
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
           D
And then begin
                                  A                      D
to see what you're doing to me this MTV is not for free
It's so PC it's killing me
    E                              A
So desperately I sing to thee of love
          E                               F#m
Sure but also rage and hate and pain and fear of self
   C#                                    D
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
         A                      D
I tried, well no in fact I lied
                   E
Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside
    A
To hide or slide
     E                            F#m
I'll do as I'll decide and let it ride until I've died
   C#
And only then shall I abide this tide
    D
Of catchy little tunes
    A
Of hip three minute ditties

    D
I wanna bust all your balloons
    E                                    A
I wanna burn all of your cities to the ground
                             E
I've found I will not mess around
           F#m
Unless I play then hey
         C#                        D
I will go on all day hear what I say
I have a prayer to pray
       A
That's really all this was
               D
And when I'm feeling stuck and need a buck
    E
I don't rely on luck

            A    E           F#m  C#
Because the hook brings you back
D          A            D   E
I ain't tellin' you no lie
     A      E        F#m  C#
The hook brings you back
D    A           D   E
On that you can rely
