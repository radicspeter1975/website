fél hanggal mélyebben (E=Eb)

E           D                  E
I sit around and watch the tube
                D              E
But nothing's on
                  D            E            D          E
I change the channels for an hour or two
           D                       E
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
              D                    E
I'm sick of all the same old shit
         D                    E
In a house with unlocked doors
                 D         B5
And I'm fuckin' lazy
 
          A5  -   E5 - B5
Bite my lip and close my eyes
           A5  -  E5 - B5
Take me away to paradise
                 A5  -  E5 - B5
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
                     A5  E
And I smell like shit
 
E5 D5 E D
 
E           D                  E
Peel me off this velcro seat
                D              E
And get me movin'
                  D            E            D          E
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
           D                       E
I'm feelin' like a dog in heat
              D                    E
Barred indoors from a summer street
         D                    E
I locked the door to my own cell
                 D         B5
And I lost the key
 
          A5  -   E5 - B5
Bite my lip and close my eyes
           A5  -  E5 - B5
Take me away to paradise
                 A5  -  E5 - B5
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
                     A5  
And I smell like shit
 
E        D
I got no motivation
E          D
Where is my motivation?
E           D
No time for a motivation
E           D   B5
Smokin' my inspiration
 
A5 - E5 - B5

E           D                  E
I sit around and watch the phone
                D              E
But no one's callin'
                  D            E            D          E
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
           D                       E
My mother says to get a job
           D                       E
But she don't like the one she's got
           D                       E
When masturbation's lost its fun
                 D         B5
You're fuckin' lazy
 
          A5  -   E5 - B5
Bite my lip and close my eyes
           A5  -  E5 - B5
Take me away to paradise
                 A5  -  E5 - B5
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
                     A5  -  E5 - B5
And loneliness has to suffice
          A5  -   E5 - B5
Bite my lip and close my eyes
           A5  -  E5 - B5
Take me away to paradise
                 A5  -  E5 - B5
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
                     A5
But it's just a myth
