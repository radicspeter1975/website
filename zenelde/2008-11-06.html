<i>Hi, my name is Stereo Mike.

Yeah, we got three tickets to the Bran Van
concert happening this Monday night at
the Pacific Pallisades. You can all dial in
if you want to answer a couple of
questions, namely, what is Todd's favourite
cheese. Jackie just called up and said
it was a form of Roquefort. We'll see about
that...

Give us a ring-ding-ding! It's a beautiful
day.

Yeah Todd, this is Liquid
ring-a-ding-a-dinging, want those three Bran Van
tickets man. Waddya think? Todd, you there?</i>

I woke up again this morning with the sun in
my eyes,
When Mike came over with a script surprise.
A Mafioso story with a twist,
A "Too Wong Foo, Julie Newmar" hit,
Get your ass out of bed, he said:
I'll explain it on the way.

But we did nothing, absolutely nothing that
day, and I say:
What the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at
26?
I got the fever for the flavour, the payback
will be late, still I need a fix.

And the girls on the bus kept on laughing at
us,
As we rode on the ten down to Venice again.
Flaring out the G-Funk,
Sipping on a juice and gin,
Just me and a friend.
Feeling kinda groovy,
Working on a movie. (Yeah right!)

But we did nothing, absolutely butkis that
day, and I say:
What the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at
26?

With my mind on my money and my money on
my... Beer, beer!

I know that life is for the taking, so I
better wise up, and take it quick.

Yeah, one more time at Trader Vic's.

Some men there wanted to hurt us,
And other men said we weren't worth the
fuss.
We could see them all bitching by the bar,
About the fine line, between the rich and
the poor.
Then Mike turned to me and said:
&quotWhat do you think we got done son?"

We've got a conclusion, and I guess that's
something, so I ask you:
What the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at
26?
I got the fever for the nectar, the payback
will be late, still I need a fix.

We need to fix you up, call me Monday and
maybe we'll fix it all up.

L.A., L.A., L.L.A, L.A.
L.A., L.A., L.L.A, L.A.
L.A., L.A., L.L.A.

So I ask you:
What the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at
26?

L.A., L.A., L.A.
