Akkordok: (félhanggal mélyebben E=Eb)
E                 G
A child arrived just the other day
A                         E
Came to the world in the usual way
E                            G
There were planes to catch, bills to pay
A                       E
He learned to walk while I was away
D
He was talking 'fore I knew it and when he could, he said
G                  E
"I'm gonna be like you, dad,
G                          E
You know I'm gonna be like you"

CHORUS:
E                           D - szerintem :)
The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
G                     A
Little boy blue and a man on the moon
E                         G
When you comin' home son, I don't know when
D                    E
We'll get together then,
G                                E
You know we'll have a good time then
