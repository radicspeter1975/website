A                  c#m           A c#m
This is the next century
A                 c#m            A c#m
Where the universal's free
E              Bm
You can find it anywhere
E                    Dsus2
Yes, the future's been sold

Every night we're gone
And to karaoke songs
How we like to sing along
though the words are wrong

Asus4                             Dsus2
It really, really, really could happen
Asus4                                 Dsus2
Yes, it really, really, really could happen
          C#m
When the days they seem to fall through you
      Bm  Dsus2   Bm   E         A,E,A,E
Well, just let them go!

No-one here is alone
Satellites in every home
Yes, the universal's here
Here for everyone
Every paper that you read
Says "Tomorrow's your lucky day!"
Well, heres your lucky day

It really, really, really could happen
Yes, it really, really, really could happen
If the days they seem to fall through you
Well, just let them go!
