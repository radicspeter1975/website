[Verse 1]
                 G
I'm through with standing in line to clubs we'll never get in
              C
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
     F                                                 G
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be
 
         G
I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
      C
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
      F                                     G
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
 
            G
I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
      C
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
      F                                 G
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty seven thousand feet
 
         G
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
       C
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
    F                                             G
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
          Bb
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
         C
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
  
[Chorus]
          G
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
            Bb
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
    C
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
      Eb                        F
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
          G
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
       Bb
In the VIP with the movie stars
      C
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
      Eb                     F
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
 
[Post-Chorus]
Bb   C                     G
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Bb   C                     G
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
  
[Verse 2]
             G
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
      C
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
         F
Sign a couple autographs
                            G
So I can eat my meals for free
            G
I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
        C
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
       F
Gonna date a centerfold that loves
                      G
To blow my money for me
  
[Pre-Chorus]
          Bb
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
         C
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
  
[Chorus]
          G
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
            Bb
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
    C
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
      Eb                        F
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
          G
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
       Bb
In the VIP with the movie stars
      C
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
      Eb                     F
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
 
          G
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
            Bb
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
    C
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
      Eb                        F
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial and
  
[Post-Chorus]
Bb   C                     G
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Bb   C                     G
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
 
[Bridge]
          Eb
I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
      Bb
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser
         Eb
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
    C                               F
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong
 
[Chorus]
          G
Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
            Bb
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
    C
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
      Eb                        F
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
          G
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
       Bb
In the VIP with the movie stars
      C
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
      Eb                     F
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
 
          G
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
            Bb
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
    C
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
      Eb                        F
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial and
 
[Post-Chorus]
Bb   C                     G
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Bb   C                     G
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
