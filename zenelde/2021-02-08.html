fél hanggal mélyebben (G=F#)

[Verse]
     G      D         C     Cmaj7
It's easier not to be wise
G              D             C      Cmaj7
Measure these things by your brains
  G         D          C  Cmaj7
I sank into Eden with you
G            D             C  Cmaj7
Alone in the church by and by
      G          D              C   Cmaj7
I'll read to you love save your eyes
G                     D          C   Cmaj7
You'll need them your boat is at sea
     G         D               C         Cmaj7
Your anchor is up, you've been swept away
         G           D               C     Cmaj7
And the greatest of teachers won't hesitate
 
   B
To leave you there by yourself chained to fate
 
[Chorus]
E  B   G
I alone love you
E  B   G
I alone tempt you
E  B   G
I alone love you
A
Fear is not the end of this
E  B   G
I alone love you
E  B   G
I alone tempt you
E  B   G
I alone love you
 
[Verse]
    G       D          C     Cmaj7
It's easier not to be great
    G              D             C   Cmaj7
And measure these things by your eyes
   G          D              C     Cmaj7
We long to be here by his resolve
  G          D             C  Cmaj7
Alone in the church by and by
    G         D        C   Cmaj7
To cradle the baby in space
   B
And leave you there by yourself chained to fate
 
[Chorus]
E  B   G
I alone love you
E  B   G
I alone tempt you
E  B   G
I alone love you
A
Fear is not the end of this
E  B   G
I alone love you
E  B   G
I alone tempt you
E  B   G
I alone love you
A

A       B

[Bridge]
B
Oh now we took it back too far
B
Only love can save us now
B
All these riddles that you burn
B
All come running back to you
B
All these rhythms that you hide
B
Only love can save us now
B
All these riddles that you burn
B           G
yeah yeah yeah
 
[Chorus]
E  B   G
I alone love you
E  B   G
I alone tempt you
E  B   G
I alone love you
A
Fear is not the end of this
E  B   G
I alone love you
