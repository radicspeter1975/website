intro: (Bb G#) 

 Bb    
   I'm looking outside of my windows 
   The view that I see 
          G# 
   Is a child and mama 
   And the child is begging for money 
            Bb 
   Tell me why, tell me why 
   The woman is blind is she so broke 
   The kid's dealing crime 
                 G# 
   It's such a beautiful city 
   But the world is burning it down 
      Bb 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
                 G# 
   It's such a beautiful city         
   But the world is it burning down 

 Bb 
   I go to my room to turn on the T.V 
   I sit myself down 
           G# 
   And I start laughing hard 
   'Cause this man he's asking for money 
          Bb    
   He sats "if you send me lots of cash I'll send you 
   Stuff to make you rich fast" 
                G# 
   It's such a wonderful country 
   But the man he's burning it down 
      Bb 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
                G# 
   It's such a wonderful country 
   But the man he's burning it down 
      Bb 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
             G# 
   And it's burning down 
   And it's called the U.S of A. 

 F#             G#                      Bb 
   One day I'm going to have lots of money 
 F#                   G#                Bb 
   But I'll have to give up for this rich society 
 F#             G#                    Bb 
   Oh please Mr. President will you lend me a future 
 F#                         G#         
   'Cause you'll just get it back 
             
            (Bb) 
   From the little blind woman 
   With the kid on the corner 
   And the people all over, doin' crack 

      Bb 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
                G# 
   It's such a wonderful country 
   But the man he's burning it down 
      Bb 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
             G# 
   And it's burning down 
   And it's called the U.S of A. 

 Bb 
   I'm walking outside on a sunny day 
   With no one around 
          G# 
   And I wonder what's wrong 
   The I hear this loud piercing siren 
 Bb   
   Oh my God the bomb has just dropped 
   And everybody climbed right on top 
                      G# 
   Screaming, what a wonderful country 
   But the man he's burning it down 
      Bb 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
                G# 
   It's such a wonderful country 
   But the man he's burning it down 
      Bb 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
   Yea yea yea yea yea yea 
             G# 
   And it's burning down 
   And it's called the U.S of A.
