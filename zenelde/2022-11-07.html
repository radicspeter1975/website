What have we done with innocence?
B                         F#  E
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
B           F#  E
adolescent resident
B                    F#   E
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
B                   F#    E
Now and then I'll try to bend
B                     F#   E
Under pressure wind up snapping in the end

B                         F#
One last thing before I quit
  E
I never wanted any more than
B                      F#
I could fit into my head
  E
I still remember every single
B                            F#
word you said and all the SHIT
     E
that somehow came along with it
      B                                F#
Still there's one thing that comforts me
      E
since I was always caged and now i'm FREE!!!

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
