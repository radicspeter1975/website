what it means to give your life to just one man
G                             Dm
Afraid of feeling nothing, no bees or buterflies.
Bb                                 C
My head is full of voices and my house is full of lies.
        G  Dm Bb C              G  Dm Bb C             G
This is home, home, and this is home, home, this is home.

I found you standing there, when I was seventen.
Bb                                 C
Now I'm thirty-two, and I can't remember what I'd see in you.
G                 Dm
A made a promise said it everyday
    Bb                                C
now I'm reading romance novels and dreaming of yesterday.

This is home, home, and this is home, home, this is home.
Bb                  C        F                   G
I'd lide to see the Riviera, now slowdance underneath the stars
C                     Bb          Dsus4
I'd like to watch the sun come up in a stranger's arms.

This is home, home, and this is home, home, this is home.

I'm going crazy a little everyday

and everything I wanted is now driving me away.
G                              Dm
I woke up this morning to the sound of breaking hearts
Bb                                   C
mine is full of questions and it's tearing yours apart,
                   G          Dm                       Bb
and it's tearing yours apart, and it's tearing yours apart,
C                  G          Dm                     Bb  C
and it's tearing yours apart, and it's tearing us apart.
