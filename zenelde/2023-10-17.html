Intro: Am  D   Fmaj7  G
Verse 1:
Am             D         Fmaj7                  G
Is it getting better;         or do you feel the same
Am               D               Fmaj7                 G
Will it make it easier on you? Now you got someone to blame
Chorus 1:
        C         Am        Fmaj7               C
You say; One love; One life; When it's one need; in the night
C            Am                 Fmaj7                      C
Its one love; we get to share it; It leaves you baby; If you don't care for it
 
Am  D   Fmaj7  G
Verse 2:
Am          D            Fmaj7                            G
Did I disappoint you?      Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
Am                      D             Fmaj7                G
You act like you never had love;     and you want me to go without
 
     C             Am         Fmaj7                       C
Well it's too late;    tonight;   to drag the past out;   into the light
C                    Am                           Fmaj7
We're one;   but we're not the same;   we get to carry each other
C                        Am  D   Fmaj7  G
Carry each other; One
 
Verse 3:
Am                      D         Fmaj7                          G
Have you come here for forgiveness? Have you come to raise the dead?
Am                          D      Fmaj7                     G
Have you come here to play Jesus?    To the lepers in your head
 
C                 Am               Fmaj7                            C
Did I ask too much; more than a lot; you gave me nothing; now it's all I got
C                     Am                Fmaj7
We're one; but we're not the same; well we hurt each other
         C
Then we do it again; you say
 
C                 Am                 C                  Am
Love is a temple; Love a higher law; Love is a temple; Love the higher law
C                        G
You ask me to enter; but then you make me crawl
G                     F
And I can't be holding on, to what you got
Fmaj7                 C
When all you got is hurt
 
        Am         Fmaj7                  C
One love; one blood; one life; you got to do what you should
C        Am             Fmaj7          C
One life; with each other; Sisters;     Brothers
C                   Am                       Fmaj7
One life; But we're not the same; we get to carry each other
C                         C   Am    Fmaj7   C
Carry each other;   one;            one
C   Am    Fmaj7   C               C   Am    Fmaj7   C
                                                    Wh-ew  Oh-Oh  Baby     Baby  Baby
C      Am    Fmaj7   C    C      Am    Fmaj7   C
Ah-Ha            Ah-Ha              Ah-Ha            Ah-Ha
