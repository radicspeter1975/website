Intro
C D# D F

Verse:
Am
can't get the stink off,
Ab                               Eb F
he's been hanging round for days.
Am
comes like a comet,
Ab                                Eb  Bb
suckered you but not your friends.
Am
one day he'll get to you,
Ab                    G   F#  F
teach you how to be a holy cow.

Chorus:
            C        F#  F
you do it to yourself you do

and that's what really hurts is
       C                F#   F
you do it to yourself just you,

you and no-one else 

       C    Eb  D   F 
you do it to yourself.   x2

Verse:

Am
don't get my sympathy
Ab                                Eb  F
hanging out the 15th floor.
Am
you've changed the lock 3 times,
Ab                                Eb  Bb
he still comes reeling through the door.
Am
and soon he'll get to you,
Ab                     G   Ab    F   
teach you how to get to purest hell.

Chorus:
            C        F#  F
you do it to yourself you do

and that's what really hurts is
       C                F#   F
you do it to yourself just you,

you and no-one else 

       C    Eb  D   F 
you do it to yourself.   x2

you do it to yourself just you,
