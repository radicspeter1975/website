[Intro]
D
 
[Verse]
D    G     A       D
I'll never let you see
D          G               A       D
The way my broken heart is hurting me
D           G           F#          Bm
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
        G               A
All the sorrow and pain
                         Bm
I'll do my crying in the rain
D    G        A      D
If I wait for stormy skies
D                  G             A           D
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
D            G           F#             Bm
You'll never know that I still love you so
         G                  A
Only the heartaches remain
                         Bm
I'll do my crying in the rain
G                       Em
Raindrops falling from heaven
       A                      D    D, D/C#
Could never take away my misery
Bm
Since we're not together
    G
I pray for stormy weather
    A
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
D
 
[Chorus]
D   G           A        D
Someday when my crying's done
D         G                A           D
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
D          G             F#        Bm               G
I may be a fool but till then, darlin' you'll never see me complain
A                         Bm
I'll do my crying in the rain

To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
