Asus2            F#m       F      A
    I put my hands where your wings should be,
Asus2            F#m                      F      A
    I put my feet where the earth should be
Bm                         C#m
    And I can't see very far
        Bm                             C#m
And when you said that you were dead I hung on 

A            F#m
   Something I feel
Bm                          D     G                   
   You are an angel  or maybe you could've been
A                     F#m
    Something out here
Bm        D     G           
    You are an angel  or maybe you could've been

A  F#m  F  A

I've got this light hangs over me
I've got this fear cuts into me
And I can't see very far
And when you said that you were dead I hung on

Something I feel
You are an angel  or maybe you could've been
Something out here
Bm                       D    G     
   You are an angel  or maybe you could've been

A  F#m  F  A 
See how they run
And nobody said you would go
A  F#m  F  A
See how they fall
And I can't see very far 

And when you said you were dead I hung on

Something I feel
You are an angel  or maybe you could've been
Something out here
Bm                       D    G                A
   You are an angel  or maybe you could've been
A                          F#m         Bm D G
   See how they run
A                          F#m
   See how they run
Bm                         D     G
        All the same,  all the same
A                       F#m  Bm          D   G A ~
   Something I feel,       you are an angel.
