Capo 1 (G=G#)
 
[Verse 1]
                 G
Every breath you take
                   Em
And every move you make
                C                     D
Every bond you break, every step you take
                   Em
I'll be watching you
              G
Every single day
                  Em
And every word you say
                 C                    D
Every game you play, every night you stay
                   G
I'll be watching you
 
[Refrain]
               C
Oh, can't you see
    Bb        G
You belong to me?
                 A
How my poor heart aches 
                   D/E
With every step you take
 
[Verse 2]
                 G
Every move you make
              Em
Every vow you break
                C                     D
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
                    Em
I'll be watching you
 
[Bridge]
Eb
Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
F
I dream at night I can only see your face
Eb
I look around but it's you I can't replace
F
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
Eb                               G
I keep crying baby, baby please
 
[Instrumental]

Oh, can't you see
              G
You belong to me?
                 A
How my poor heart aches 
                   D/E
With every step you take
 
[Verse 3]
                 G
Every move you make
              Em
Every vow you break
                C                     D
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
                    Em
I'll be watching you
                C                     D
Every move you make, every step you take
                    Em
I'll be watching you
