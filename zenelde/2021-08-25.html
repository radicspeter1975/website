intro:
e' d#' b g#
e' d#' b f# 

E/B             B
I can't get to sleep

D            A
I think about the implications

Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be alright
Perhaps its just my imagination

C#/Dbmin    B
Day after day it reappears

C#/Dbmin            B
Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear

G#/Ab               A      ....B
Ghosts appear and fade away

Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill...

Day after day it reappears

Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away come back another day..

Lead Solo (Follows the same pattern)
