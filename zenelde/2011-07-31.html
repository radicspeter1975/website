Capo: 1st Fret (D=Eb)

He [D]drinks, he smokes,
he cuss, he swears he tells bad jokes
And he [A]ropes, and he rides, 
he lives life fast and he loves to fight
He's a [D]boozer, a loser,
he calls me up when he's had too much
He's a [G]schemer, a dreamer
I [Em7]tell him to change his ways,
[A]but he just turns, to me and says,
I (I) ain't (ain't) no [D]quitter

CHORUS:
[G]I ain't givin' up on him just [D]yet
[G]'cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can [D]get
No [Em7]he won't quit, but [D/F#]you can bet,
[G]I'm sticking to it, [A]I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no [D]quitter

Well he [D]chews, and he spits,
well he flirts too much and he loves blonde chicks
And he [A]struts, and he strolls,
he looks so cool and yep he knows!
He's a [D]beauty, a cutie,
his body rocks and the girls they flock
He's af[G]flicted, addicted
I [Em7]tell him to change his ways,
but [A]he just turns to me and says,
I (I) ain't (ain't) no [D]quitter

CHORUS

INSTRUMENTAL:  [D]  [A]  [D]

Ooh, [D]his body rocks and the girls they flock,
he's af[G]flicted, addicted
I [Em7]tell him to change his ways,
but [A]he just turns to me and says,
I (I) ain't (ain't) no [D]quitter

[G]I ain't givin' up on him just [D]yet
[G]'cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can [D]get

CHORUS

[A]I (I) ain't (ain't), I ain't no [D]quitter
[A]I (I) ain't (ain't), I ain't no [D]quitter
