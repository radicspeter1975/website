[Verse 1]
        Dm                           Am
They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
    Dm                                 Am
For trying to change the system from within
    Dm                         Am
I'm coming now I'm coming to reward them
G                F       E               Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

 
[Verse 2]
    Dm                        Am
I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
    Dm                             Am
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
    Dm                          Am
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
G                F       E               Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
  
[Chorus]
    C                               G
I'd really like to live beside you, baby
F    G         C                             Am
  I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
        Dm                                     Am
But you see that line there moving through the station
  G           F         E                     Am
I told you, I told you, told you I was one of those

 
[Verse 3]
    Dm                               Am
You loved me as a loser but now your worried that I just might win
    Dm                              Am
You know the way to stop me but you don't have the discipline
   Dm                                  Am
How many nights I prayed for this: to let my work begin
G                F       E               Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
  
[Verse 4]
Dm                                  Am
I don't like your fashion business, mister
Dm                                     Am
I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
Dm                                 Am
I don't like what happened to your sister
G                F       E               Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
  
[Chorus]
    C                               G
I'd really like to live beside you, baby
F    G         C                             Am
  I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
        Dm                                     Am
But you see that line there moving through the station
  G           F         E                     Am
I told you, I told you, told you I was one of those
  
[Verse 5]
      Dm                                 Am
And I thank you for those items that you sent me
    Dm                        Am
The monkey end the plywood violin
  Dm                            Am
I practiced every night now I'm ready
G                F       E               Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
 
[Verse 6]
  Dm                            Am
Remember me, I used to live for music
  Dm                                  Am
Remember me, I brought your groceries in
     Dm                           Am
It's Father's Day and everybody's wounded
G                F       E               Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
 
[Outro]
A      G Am
(Repeat and fade out)
