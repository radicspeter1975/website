[Verse]
D
Life was going great Love would have to wait
           G
Was in no hurry  Had no worries
D
Staying single was the plan  Didn't need a steady man
            G
I had it covered  til I dicovered
 
[Chorus]
A             G              A                 G
Love gets me every time  My heart changed my mind
A
it gall darn gone and done it      lick see top of page
          G
Gone and done it (gone and done it)
             D
Yes, I fell in love (gone and done it)
D                   G
Must have been the way he walks (gone and done it)
         D
Or his sweet sweet talks  (gone and done it)
        A     G                                       D  G
I guess I I I I gall darn gone (gone-ne) and done it

[Verse]
D
I was quite content Just paying my rent
           G
It was my place I needed my space
D
I was free to shop around in no rush to settle down
           G
I had it covered til I discovered
 
[Chorus]
A             G              A                 G
Love gets me every time  My heart changed my mind
A
it gall darn gone and done it      lick see top of page
          G
Gone and done it (gone and done it)
             D
Yes, I fell in love (gone and done it)
D                   G
Must have been the way he walks (gone and done it)
         D
Or his sweet sweet talks  (gone and done it)
                     G
It's in the way he calls my name
                  D
I know I'll never be the same
Don't cha know
A             G              A                 G
Love gets me every time  My heart changed my mind
A
it gall darn goo-ooo-ne and done it
D
Thought I had it covered   Uh huh   Life was great
Well I gall darn gone and done it
