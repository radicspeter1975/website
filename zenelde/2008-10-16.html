[Verse 1]
E                  D
Every day, I get up
                       Bm                D
Put my black plastic security suit on my gasmask
                           E
Leave the cellar and go to work
             D
Afraid to be poisoned or trampelled
        Bm
By this huge machinery
      D
And I think to myself
 
 
[Verse 2]
     E
What f\*\*\* above
     D
Do I have to thank
         Bm
That I'm here to live
        D
In this s\*\*\* I don't
         E
Wanna complain about
         D
The acid rain 'cause it's
        Bm
Nice compared to this
       D
Poison Air
      E            D
And I wish I could just
             Bm
Once see the moon
        D
Oh, one gorgeous show
     E
So I take it off
            D
Yeah that's feeling good
           Bm
Though I'm deeply sick
      D
Right away
 
 
[Chorus]
                         A
It's like dancing in the sun
                      G
Having trouble having fun
                    Bm            D
Having anything you wish to come
                            A
Then it finally smiles your way
        G            F#    G
And you have an easy day
                          Bm        G
It's time to have an easy day
                          Bm        G
It's time to have an easy day
                          Bm                G            Bm
It's time to have an easy day, It's time to have an easy day,
             G            Bm                G            E
It's time to have an easy day, It's time to have an easy day
 
D Bm D    E D Bm D
 
 
[Verse 3]
E
   What the hell
          D                           Bm
This must be an antique supermarket
 
What am I doing here
    D                      E
God, these people drinking milk
                     D
But the clothes they wear
                       Bm
Look rather cool to me
                    D
And I wear the same
                      E
What am I doing here?
 
 
[Verse 4]
               D                      Bm
Excuse me, Sir, can you help me out?
                         D
I wanna bake a cake but I don't know how
E                   D
No, I don't but I'm sure I will
        Bm
So what do we need
         D
For your bakery?
 
 
[Chorus]
                         A
It's like dancing in the sun
                      G
Having trouble having fun
                    Bm            D
Having anything you wish to come
                            A
Then it finally smiles your way
        G            F#    G
And you have an easy day
                                D
It's like, It's like, It's like
                         A
It's like dancing in the sun
                      G
Having trouble having fun
                    Bm            D
Having anything you wish to come
                            A
Then it finally smiles your way
        G            F#    G
And you have an easy day
                          Bm        G
It's time to have an easy day
                          Bm        G
It's time to have an easy day
                          Bm                G            Bm
It's time to have an easy day, It's time to have an easy day,
             G            Bm                G            Bm
It's time to have an easy day, It's time to have an easy day,
             G            Bm        G         Bm         G
It's time to have an easy daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay yeah
     Bm        G         Bm        G

     Bm        G         Bm        G

     Bm        G         Bm        G

[Outro]
Bm            G              Bm             G
every working morning tired, yawn too often I got fired
Bm                G        Bm              G
wondered if there is a god searching for a fishingrod
     Bm                     G                   Bm           G
with hooks that sting right through our hearts, forcing us onto new starts
Bm                 G            Bm             G    Bm
love and knowledge are the way, try to have an easy day.
