(Intro)   D    F    G    C  (2x)  

(Verse 1)  

D             F         G    C  
My friends are so depressed....I feel the  
D                F       G      C  
Question of your loneliness....Confide...'cause  
D               F  G     C  
I'll be on your side....You know I will...  
D       F         G   C  
....You know I will.......        
    
Ex-girlfriend called me up  
Alone and desperate on the prison phone  
They want to give her seven years  
For being sad  

C      Am         C    D      A  
I love all of you, Hurt by the cold  
C          Am              C       D         A  
So hard and lonely too, ...When you don't know yourself   

My friends are so distressed  
And standing on the brink of emptiness  
No words I know of to express  
This emptiness  

C      Am         C    D      A  
I love all of you, Hurt by the cold  
C          Am              C       D         A  
So hard and lonely too, ...When you don't know yourself   

(Solo)   Same chords as intro (x4)  
         (Except the very last C chord is Csus2)  

(Bridge)  
E       G  F#              F  C          B      F  
Imagine me taught by tragedy, Release is peace  

I heard a little girl  
And what she said  
Was something beautiful  
To give your love  
No matter what she said  

C      Am         C    D      A  
I love all of you, Hurt by the cold  
C          Am              C       D         A  
So hard and lonely too, ...When you don't know yourself   

Solo.. and intro (lenta)
