(fél hanggal mélyebben A=G#)

A                Bm   D
Just a girl who can't say no
A            Bm D
And her sweetheart on parole
A                   Bm   D
Parents named her Jupiter
A           Bm    D
To bless her with a lucky soul

A                 Bm   D
He's a boy who never cried
A              Bm   D
When they lock him up inside
A                   Bm          D
And she nicknamed him her Teardrop
A             Bm    D
For the tattoo by his eye

E            D
Now she's sleepin' in her bed
E           ?   D
And he's sleepin' in her bed
A               Bm            D
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
A               Bm              D
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop

She divines by radio
Pushing buttons show to show
And she wonders 'bout the fate of
Lovers in the barrio

She forgets after awhile
When she tune in on the dial
Jackie Wilson's 'Lonely Teardrops'
As she drive another mile

Now she's sleepin' in her bed
And he's sleepin' in her bed
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop

Solo:

E [----------------5----9-7-9-7-5-5-7-5-------7------]
B [--5-5-5-5-7----7------------------------5---------]

And they want to have a child
Walk together down the aisle
But they live in is mean
And it's built on sheer denial

The phone rings,  it's for her
"I gotta see you,  Jupiter"
"I'm in trouble with the law"
"Bring my 38-caliber"

Now she's sleepin' in her bed
As she pulls the phone plug dead
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop, oh
And it's Jupiter and Teardrop
And it's Jupiter and Tear...
And it's Jupiter and Tear...

Outro: E  ?  D 
          E  ?  D
