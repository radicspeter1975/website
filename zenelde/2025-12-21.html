[Verse]
G
Stay by my side it's over
G
The ride isn't what I told you
     Em7
The painkiller side of this life
       G
Is to not look behind it's over
 
G
I have been told about longing
G
A feeling so old, it's dead
Em7
I must have been misled
    G
So stay by my side I'm sorry
 
[Pre-Chorus]
      A7
I'm drawing myself the ideal crash
       A
But I know I won't believe me
G
There'll be a time you'll leave me
 
[Verse]
G
Stay by my side, it's sexy
G
The way that we talk about stuff
    Em7
The way that we laugh with love
    G
The way that we're falling off
 
[Chorus]
C
Crash
                                      Am
Your life’s been sucking ‘cause you wanna mess around
    G                         C
Can anybody down you with a crash?
                                  Am                G
Another way of saying that you’d like to make it up as you move along
           F
If it's a lot, show them what you got
 
[Verse]
G
Stay by my side, I want you
G
Continue the theme that's us
Em7
Even though it's only lust
     G
The painkiller side of this life
 
[Pre-Chorus]
      A7
I'm drawing myself the ideal crash
       A
And I know I won't believe me
G
How can a man kill gently?
G
How long before it's all done?
Em7
How can he leave someone?
G
How can he do it softly?
 
[Chorus]
C
Crash
                                      Am
Your life’s been sucking ‘cause you wanna mess around
    G                         C
Can anybody down you with a crash?
                                  Am                G
Another way of saying that you’d like to make it up as you move along
           F
If it's a lot, show them what you got
 
C
Crash
                                Am
You're gonna go to hell with a certain inclination
G                                   C
Try and make it sell and then you crash
                                    Am                 G
You're gonna have to take yourself out of circulation, into something else
           F                   Am
If it's a lot, show them what you got
                     F                    Am
Right now I need my hands, to cover this shit up
           F               Am
I need my eyes to see were I'm going
            F      Am
And I need someone
 
[Outro]
G
Stay by my side, it's sexy
G
The way that we talk about stuff
     Em7
The way that we laugh with love
     G
The way that we're falling off
