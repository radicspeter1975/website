fél hanggal mélyebben: em=d#m

            Em               A        G
Oh well the church bells are calling
Em            A     G
Police car on fire
            Em                          A            G
And as they call you to the eye of the storm all the people say
Em              A
Stay at home tonight

I say...

C          G
We are the pigs
Bm         Em    G
We are the swine
C          G
We are the stars
               A                  Em
Of the firing line, of the firing line

Bridge: Em A Em A

           Em                    A     G
And as the smack cracks at your window
    Em                             A  G
You wake up with a gun in your mouth
           Em                   A    G
Oh let the nuclear wind blow away my sins and I'll
Em                 A
Stay at home in my house

I say...

C          G
We are the pigs
Bm         Em    G
We are the swine
C          G
We are the stars
         A
Of the firing line...

C          G
We are the pigs
Bm         Em    G
We are the swine
C          G
We are the stars
         A                        Em
Of the firing line, of the firing line

Bridge: Em A Em A

Solo over chords from verse & chorus, then:

C          G
We are the pigs
Bm         Em    G
We are the swine
C          G
We are the stars
         Bm           Em
Of the firing... but deceit can't save you so
C   G
Oh, oh,
Bm               Em
We'll watch them burn
