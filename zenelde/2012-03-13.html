E                f#m                     g#m
My sister was at court accused of being bored 
                 A          B             E 
Her lawyer was a friend, he knew how to defend 

E                f#m                     g#m
The day the trial starts she wandered through the park 
                 A          B              A             B 
A squirrel came to her and asked why are you bored 
          A      B               A  B                   A B E
I'm an astronaut - i'm an astronaut - i'm an astronaut 
        
E      f#m         g#m      A 
I'm an astronaut without a cause 
A     g#m    B
Without a cause 

The judge told her to swear, the truth is to be said 
Innocently speaking, she answered i don't care 
Immediately she opened the window at the back 
Crossed her arms, beneath her head

I'm an astronaut without a cause
Without a cause 

A
Nameless, spotless, unexpected, drop the morbid monkey
A squirrel came to her and asked why 
I'm an as...tronaut...without...a... 
Hoooo hoooo hoooo 
Hoooo hoooo hoooo 
I'm an astronaut, i'm an astronaut, i'm an astronaut
