Burn the books
They've got too many names
And psychoses
All this incriminating evidence
Would surely haunt me
If someone broke into my house

(start strumming the guitar)

G - Am - C - Dsus4
Suits in the living room
Do  you realize guys
I was born in 1974
We've got someone here
To explain your publishing
We know how much you love to be
In front of audiences

Chorus:
G - Am - C - Dsus4
Hopeful you are
Schoolbound you are
Naive you are
Driven you are

Take a trip to New York
With your guardian 
And your fake identification
When they said
“is there something  anything
you'd like to know young lady?
You said “yes I'd like to know
what kind of people
I'll be dealing with”

Precocious you are
Headstrong you are
Terrified you are
Ahead of your time you are

Don't mind our staring but
We're surprised
You're not in a far-gone asylum
We're surprised
You didn't crack up
Lord knows what we would've
We would've liked
To have been there
But you keep pushing us away

Resilient you are
Big time you are
Ruthless you are
Precious you are

until fade

G - Am - C - Dsus4
