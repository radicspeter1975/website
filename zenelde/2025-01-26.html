[Intro]
C7     F7
C7     F7
C7     F7
Bb
 
[Verse 1]
C7
You jump in front of my car when you
F7
You know all the time that
C7                                  F7
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
Bb7                       Eb
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
Ab7                         G7
You say you just want me to take you for a ride
 
[Chorus]
                 C7
You're just like crosstown traffic
           F7
So hard to get through to you
C7
Crosstown traffic
                F7
I don't need to run over you
C7
Crosstown traffic
              F7
All you do is slow me down
        Bb
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town
 
[Verse 2]
C7                              F7
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
C7
Tire tracks all across your back
      F7
I can see you had your fun
Bb7                           Eb
But darling can't you see my signals turn from green to red
Ab7                                     G7
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead
 
[Chorus]
                 C7
You're just like crosstown traffic
           F7
So hard to get through to you
C7
Crosstown traffic
                F7
I don't need to run over you
C7
Crosstown traffic
              F7
All you do is slow me down
        Bb
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town
