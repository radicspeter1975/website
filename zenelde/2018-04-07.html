[Intro]
Dm

[Verse]
   Dm    Cadd9   G/B         Bb
I won't stand in your   way
         Dm  A/C#  F/C   D
Let your hat-red grow
              Gm
And she'll scream
             Dm/F
And she'll shout
            Em7b5    Ebmaj7
And she'll pray
        A7sus4
And she had a name
           A
Yeah, she had a name 

And I won't hold you back
Let your anger rise
And we'll fly
And we'll fall
And we'll burn
No-one will recall
No-one will recall

G   F#   F

[Chorus]
  F          A/E             Dm
This is the last time I'll a-ban-don you
           F    A/E                Dm        Bb
And this is the last time I'll for-get you
I wish I could

F   G#   A   C  C# Dm

[Verse]
Look to the stars
Let hope burn in your eyes
And we'll love
And we'll hate
And we'll die
All to no avail
All to no avail

G   F#   F

This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is the last time I'll forget you
I wish I could

F   G#   A   C  C# Dm
Dm   C/D   Dm   Dm/F
Gm   Dm/F   Em7b5   Ebmaj7   A   A
G   F#   F

[Chorus]
This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is the last time I'll forget you
I wish I could

F   G#   A   C  C#
F   G#   A   C  C#      

I wish I could

Dm
