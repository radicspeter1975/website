Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed
And it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know
Exactly where I stand
This world is forcing me
To hold your hand

       Bm          A     G          A
'Cause I am just a girl, little ol' me
Bm           A           G      A
Don't let me out of your sight
Bm         A         G          A
I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
   Bm           A        G       A
So don't let me have any rights
G         C  (the G and C are palm muted)
Oh...I've had it up to here!

The moment that I step outside
So many reasons
For me to run and hide
I can't do the little things
I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things
That I fear

       Bm          A
'Cause I am just a girl
    G          A
I'd rather not be
            Bm           A
'Cause they won't let me drive
        G      A
Late at night
Bm         A
I'm just a girl
          G            A
Guess I'm some kind of freak
            Bm          A
'Cause they all sit and stare
           G     A
With their eyes
Bm         A
I'm just a girl
       G            A
Take a good look at me
          Bm      A        G   A
Just your typical prototype
G         C  (the G and C are palm muted)
Oh...I've had it up to here!

Bm-A-G-A thing 4 times>

G         C  (G and C muted)
Oh...I am making myself clear?

I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world...
That's all that you'll let me be!

Bm         A            G         A
I'm just a girl, living in captivity
             Bm
Your rule of thumb
         A     G     A
Makes me worry some
Bm         A     G              A
I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
           Bm
What I've succumbed to
   A         G     A
Is making me numb
Bm         A        G    A
I'm just a girl, my apologies
          Bm        A        G     A
What I've become is so burdensome
Bm         A     G     A
I'm just a girl, lucky me
        Bm          A       G    A
Twiddle-dum there's no comparison
G         C  (G's and C's muted throughout)
Oh...I've had it up to!
G         C
Oh...I've had it up to!
G         C            Bm
Oh...I've had it up to here!
(slow down on the last G and let the final Bm ring out)
