Intro:  A  E\*D  2x

  A
I hate the world today
E\*D                      A
You're so good to me I know but I can't change
E\*D                         F#m
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe
        Bm             D
I'm and angel underneath innocent and sweet
  
(same as stanza 1)
Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved to see the softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one

Refrain:
      A                       E
I'm a bitch I'm a lover I'm a child I'm a mother
      Bm                 D
I'm a sinner I'm a saint I do not feel ashamed
         A                       E
I'm your hell I'm your dream I'm nothing in between
             F#m                        D
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extreme tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing

Refrain:
I'm a bitch I'm a lover I'm a child I'm a mother
I'm a sinner I'm a saint I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell I'm your dream I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Solo:  A  E  F#m  D  A  E  Bm  D 

Bridge:
E
Just when you think you got me
                F#m                  D
Figured out the season's already changin'
E                     F#m               D
I think it's cool you do what ya do and don't try to save me

Refrain:
I'm a bitch I'm a lover I'm a child I'm a mother
I'm a sinner I'm a saint I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell I'm your dream I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Outro:
I'm a bitch I'm a tease I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt when you suffer I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb I'm revived can't say I'm not alive
You know I woulden't want it any other way

 A  E  F#m  D  A  E  F#m  D  A
