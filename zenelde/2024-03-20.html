[Verse 1]
D
I like black coffee and cigarettes
    C
And flowers from boys
G
that I'm not sleeping with
D
I like trees when they let go of their leaves
C
They're so wise,
     G
they get rid of their shit
 
 
[Verse 2]
      D
Yeah, I like black coffee and cigarettes
    C                   G
And crying to hard rock   on my holidays
D
Dreams are loud in every street
        C
There's nothing as sweet
   G
as living in Madrid
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         D
And it's all in my head, everyone in my bed
      Bm               A
Baby,    stop calling,   stop calling
        D
I said,   maybe, maybe it's all in my head
            Bm                  A N.C.
I told you,    to stop calling
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.                          G
  Don't look at me with those eyes
A                                G
Just don't look at me with those eyes
A                                  G
Please don't look at me with those eyes
A                               D
Va, don't look at me with those eyes
 
 
[Interlude]
D   A   Bm   A
 
 
[Verse 3]
              D
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I like black coffee and cigarettes
    C
And pulling you strong (Strong strong strong)
G
From that chain that's on your neck
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D
Was it me, was it life?  When did love get so fucked up
Bm
Lonely hearts, killing time
A
Begging Venus for a shag
G
  There is no mercy   Time for quality time
           A                            N.C.
With those faces on their faces to hide   you?
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.                          G
  Don't look at me with those eyes
A                                G
Just don't look at me with those eyes
A                                  G
Please don't look at me with those eyes
A                               D
Va, don't look at me with those eyes
 
 
[Outro]
D   A   Bm   A
D
