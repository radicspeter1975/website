[Intro]
Em Bm Em Bm F G F G
 
Am   G                 C   C
Once    there was this kid who
F           C            G                C
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
    F    F          G    C
But when he finally came back
G   C    F               C      G     G       G
His hair had turned from black into bright white
   G#               C
He said that it was from when
    G#               Cmaj7(Add F) Cmaj7(Add F) F F
The cars had smashed soooo                     hard
 
[CHORUS] 
Em     Bm   Em     Bm      F    G    F    G
Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm, Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm
 
Am   G                C    C
Once   there was this girl who
F              C               G            C
Wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room
    F    C              G    C
But when   they finally made her
G    C    F         C        G    G    G
They saw    birthmarks all over her body
    G#               C
She couldn't quite explain it
    G#             Cmaj7(Add F) Cmaj7(Add F) F F
They'd always just been                      there 
 
[CHORUS]
Em     Bm   Em     Bm      F    G    F    G
Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm, Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm
 
Am   G                C    C
Once   there was this girl who
F              C               G#           C
Wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room
    F    C              G    C

They'd always just been                      there
  
[BRIDGE]
Dm        Dm  C    G      G
Both girl and boy were glad
Dm        Dm   C      G   F          G
One kid had it worse than that
       Am   G             C   C
'Cause then   there was a boy whose
F                C                 G            C
Parents made him come right home directly after school
    F    C            G     C
And when they went to their church
G    C     F        C        G            G       G
They shook   and lurched all over the church floor
   G#               C
He couldn't quite explain it
       G#          Cmaj7(Add F) Cmaj7(Add F) F     F
They'd always just gone                      there
  
PLAY CHORUS TWICE
 
Outro is the same progression as the bridge. As my guitar doesn't have a
built-in fade-out :-), I end this song like this:
 
Dm Dm C G Em Bm Em Bm     F       G
