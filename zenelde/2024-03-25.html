<pre>
Time goes by
Even if I hide
I thought I
Wouldn't have a past
But it's fun to me
I'm not twenty-three
Not going back again
Not going back again
But I can't complain
I still have my friends
Not going back again
Not going back again
I'm feeling everything
Maybe it's killing me
I'm feeling everything with you
Maybe it's the best thing
Did I change?
Did I learn something?
And I'm sure
I'd do it again
I'm feeling everything
Maybe it's killing me
I'm feeling everything with you
Maybe it's the best thing
I'm feeling everything
Maybe it's killing me
I'm feeling everything with you
Maybe it's the best thing
I'm feeling everything
I'm feeling everything
I'm feeling everything
I'm feeling everything
