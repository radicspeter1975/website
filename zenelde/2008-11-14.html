C#         F#
I gave you all I had
I gave you good and bad
C#         F#                C#    F#
I gave but you just threw it back

I won't get on my knees
Don't make me do that please
I've been away but now I'm back

Don't be too sure of that
What makes you sure of that
You went away you can't come back

I walked away from you
I hurt you through and through
Aw honey give me one more chance

Aw you're a lucky son
Lucky son of a gun

C#         F#
You went away
you went away
C#         F#                  H      F#
You went away but now youre back

I got down on my knees
And then I begged you please
I always knew you'd take me back
