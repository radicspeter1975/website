[Verse]
D                     Bm
Who can say where the road goes
          G
where the day flows
    D
only time
                        Bm
And who can say if your love grows
        G
as your heart chose
     D
only time

D                    Bm
Who can say why your heart sighs
        G

                         Bm
And who can say why your heart cries

Who can say when the roads meet
         G
that the might be
    D
in your heart
                         Bm
And who can say when the day sleeps
       G                   D
if the night keeps all your heart
G                   D
night keeps all your heart
