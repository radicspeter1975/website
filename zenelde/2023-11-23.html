(fél hanggal mélyebben D=C#)

D         A         D                 A
Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
D        A         G           A
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
G            D       G              D
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
G             C        G       D
Helpless to resist the notes I write
    Em            A     A7     D
For I compose the music of the night
 
D       A       D                 A
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour
D         A         G             A
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
G            D         G          D
Hearing is believeing, music is deceiving
G                  C       G     D
Hot as lightening, soft as candlelight
Em                 A     A7     D
Dare you trust the music of the night
 
          C                            F
Close you eyes for your eyes will only tell the truth
        Bb                           E7
and the truth isn't what you want to see
       A          A7         D
In the dark it is easy to pretend
         F#m      C#               F#
That the truth is what it ought to be
 
D       A       D             A
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
D        A        G           A
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
G            D              G           D
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
        G                  C        G      D
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
    Em              A     A7     D
The darkness of the music of the night
 
           C            G                 F
Close your eyes start a journey through a strange new world
          Bb                             E7
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
           A            A7            D
Close your eyes and let music set you free
     F#m      C#            F#
Only then can you belong to me
 
D                    A                  D           A
Floating (floating), falling (falling), sweet intoxication
D                    A                    G               A
Touch me (touch me), trust me (trust me), savour each sensation
G               D             G           D
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
       G            C     G      D
To the power of the music that I write
Em               A     A7     D
The power of the music of the night....
 
[Instrumental]
[Chorus two lines]
D      A       D      A
D      A       G      A
 
G           D
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah..
G           D
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...
G    D
Ah-ah-ah...
A     A7       D
Aaaaaaaaaah... oooh..
G             C       G         D
You and I can make my song take flight
Em      A        A7           G    Em   Ebm   C#   D
Help me make the music of the night.
(starts on "night")
Help me make the music of the night
