CHORUS:
A                   E                       D             Bm
Do you remember the time I knew a girl from Mars, I don't know if you knew that
A                            E                      D               Bm                D
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards, Henri Winterman cigars, and she never told me her name 
        E                       A
I still love you, the girl from Mars
 
VERSE 1:
A            E      D           Bm            D         E      A
Sitting in a dreamy daze by the water's edge, on a cool summer night
              E            D           Bm            D         E   A
Fireflies and stars in the sky, gentle glowing light from your cigarette
           E       D      Bm          D             E         A
The breeze blowing softly on my face, reminds me of something else
               E     D          Bm              D        E         Bm    D        E           A
Something that in my memory has been misplaced, suddenly all comes back, and as I look to the stars
 
CHORUS:
A              E                       D             Bm
I remember the time I knew a girl from Mars, I don't know if you knew that
A                            E                      D               Bm                D
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards, Henri Winterman cigars, and she never told me her name 
        E                       A
I still love you, the girl from Mars
 
VERSE 2:
A                   E        D        Bm                    D       E      A
Surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand, electricity in the air
             E           D            Bm       D        E        A
Twisting all through the night on the terrace, now that summer's here
       E       D         Bm                  D      E       A
I know you are almost in love with me, I can see it in your eyes
              E          D        Bm                  D      E        Bm    D        E           A
Strange light shimmering over the sea tonight, and it almost blows my mind, and as I look to the stars  
 
CHORUS:
A              E                       D             Bm
I remember the time I knew a girl from Mars, I don't know if you knew that
A                            E                      D               Bm                D
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards, Henri Winterman cigars, and she never told me her name 
        E                       A
I still love you, the girl from Mars

BREAK:
A       E            D            Bm         D          E       A
Today I sleep in the chair by the window, it felt as if you'd returned
               E        D        Bm              D              E      Bm
I thought that you were standing over me, when I woke there was no one there
        Bm        E         A
I still love you, girl from Mars

Oh we'd stay up late playing cards, Henri Winterman cigars, and she never told me her name 
A                   E                       D             Bm
Do you remember the time I knew a girl from Mars, I don't know if you knew that
A                            E                      D             Bm             D
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards, Henri Winterman cigars, and I still dream of you 
        E                       A
I still love you, the girl from Mars
