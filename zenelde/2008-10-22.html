<pre>
To pretend and one can find,
Fantasies and morning rose,
Forbidden fruit, hidden lies,
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now.

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true, not like you do.

Covered by the blind belief,
That fantasies of sinful screams,
Bare the facts or sooner die,
End the vows no need to lie in chain
Take a ride, take a shot now.

'Cause nobody loves me, its true, not like you do.

Am I what and why?
'Cause all I have left is my memories of yesterday,
Oh the sour times

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true, not like you do.

After time the bitter taste,
Of innocence disintegrates,
Scattered seed, buried lives,
Histories of our disguise reborn,
Circumstance will decide

'Cause nobody loves me, its true, not like you do X3
