F       C          dm        Bb                F
Must be your skin, I'm sinkin' in.  Must be for real,    'Cause now I can feel.
        C            dm             Bb         F
I didn't mind,  It's not my kind.  It's not my time,    To wonder why.
             C      dm       Bb                F
Everything's gone white, Everything's gray.  Now you're here, Now you're away.
         C           dm           Bb         F
Don't want this, Remember that. I'll never forget, Where you're at.

Chorus:
C         dm      Bb
Don't let the days go by.
    F   C   Bb  F
Glycerine       Glycerine
F       C       Bb      F

I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time. 
Are you at one, Do you lie.
We live on a wheel, Where everyone steals.
And when we rise, It's like strawberry fields.
Treated you bad,You bruise my face. 
Couldn't love you more,You've got a beautiful taste.

Bridge:
C       dm     Bb   F         C    dm
Don't let the days go by, Could've been easier on you.
         Bb             F
I couldn't change, Though I wanted to.
        C     dm            Bb        F     C   Bb
Should've been easier by three, Our old friend fear, and you and me.
    F       C   Bb  F
Glycerine           Glycerine
C         dm      Bb        F
Don't let the days go by    Glycerine
C          dm      Bb       F   C   Bb  F   C
Don't let the days go by
dm      Bb      F       C
Glycerine   Glycerine
dm      Bb
Glycerine   Glycerine
dm      Bb      dm      Bb
Bad moon white again,   Bad moon white again.
    dm      Bb      F
As she falls around me.

Needed you more, You wanted us less.
Could not kiss, Just regress.
It might just be,
Clear simple and plain. 
Well that's just fine,That's just one of my names.

Outro:
C          dm      Bb   F           C       dm         Bb
Don't let the days go by,   Could have been easier on you. . .you. . .you. . .
    F       C   Bb  F       C   Bb
Glycerine           Glycerine
    F       C   Bb  F       C   Bb  F
