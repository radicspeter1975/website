[Verse 1]
A#                                                    F
I don't even know myself at all; I thought I would be happy, by now
Dm                                          C          F
The more I try to push it, I realize, gotta let go of control
             A#                  F
Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen
             Dm     C         F
Gotta let it happen, so let it happen

[Chorus 1]
             A#              Dm                  C
It's just a spark, but it's enough to keep me going
              A#                  F                    C
And when it's dark out, no one's around, it keeps glowing

[Pre-verse 2]
A# F Dm C F

[Verse 2]
A#                                                    F
Every night I try my best to dream, tomorrow makes it better
A#                                            F
And wake up to the cold reality, and nothing is changed
            A#                  F
But it will happen, gotta let it happen
             A#                  F
Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen

[Chorus 2]
             A#5             Dm5                 C5
It's just a spark, but it's enough to keep me going
              A#5                 F5                   C5
And when it's dark out, no one's around, it keeps glowing
             A#5             Dm5                 C5
It's just a spark, but it's enough to keep me going
              A#5                 F5                   C5
And when it's dark out, no one's around, it keeps glowing

[Bridge]
         F                                                A#
But the salt in my wounds isn't burning any more than it used to
             Dm                                    C                          F
It's not that I don't feel the pain, It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
          F                                                   A#
And the blood in these veins isn't pumping any less than it ever has
                Dm                   C                             F5
And that's the hope I have, the only thing I know is keeping me alive

[Post-bridge]
    F5             A#5
And I gotta let it happen
            F5                    Dm5
Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen
C5          F5                    A#5
Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen
            F5                    Dm5
Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen
C5          F5
Gotta let it happen

[Chorus 3]
             A#5             Dm5                 C5
It's just a spark, but it's enough to keep me going
              A#5                 F5                   C5
And when it's dark out, no one's around, it keeps glowing
             A#5             Dm5                 C5
It's just a spark, but it's enough to keep me going
              A#5                 F5                   C5
And when it's dark out, no one's around, it keeps glowing
