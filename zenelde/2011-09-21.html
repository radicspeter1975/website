<i>Hugh Heffner: Ah, thank you darling.
Calls Pat Riiiiiiing Riiiiiiing
Pat: Hello?
Hugh: Pat, it's Heff. I hear Weezer has a new record coming out. 
Pat: That's true. 
Hugh: What'd you say you come by the house and play it for the girls?
Pat: That sounds fine. Do you mind if I bring some friends?
Hugh: Whatever you want. Just don't bring too many dudes. They're coming.</i>

Verse

F             Bb        
 Where I come from isn't all that great
F              Bb
 My automobile is a piece of crap
F           Bb                C
 My fashion sense is a little whack
                           E
 And my friends are just as screwy as me

F         Bb
 I didn't go to boarding schools
F         Bb
 Preppy girls never looked at me
F           Bb              C
 Why should they I ain't nobody
                  E
 Got nothing in my pocket

F        Bb      C              Bb    F    Bb

 Living in Beverly Hills
F        Bb      C              Bb     F   Bb
 Beverly Hills - Rolling like a celebrity
C                 E
 Living in Beverly Hills
F         Bb
 Look at all those movie stars
F               Bb
 They're all so beautiful and clean
F         Bb                   C
 When the housemaids scrub the floors 
                         E
They get the spaces in between
F        Bb
 I wanna live a life like that
F        Bb
 I wanna be just like a king
F        Bb             C
 Take my picture by the pool 
                       E
Cause I'm the next big thing

F        Bb      C              Bb      F   Bb

F           Bb  F               Bb
 The truth is...I don't stand a chance
F                               Bb
 Its something that you're born into
C                         E
And I just don't belong

       F                Bb                  F
No I don't - I'm just a no class, beat down fool
           F              Bb
And I will always be that way
           F             C
I might as well enjoy my life
                    E
And watch the stars play

F        Bb      C              Bb    F    Bb
 Beverly Hills - That's where I wanna be!
C                 E
