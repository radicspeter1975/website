Intro: C F G
Verses:
      C                Dm
Yeah, once upon a time you dressed so fine
    Em                    F              G          G7
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
C                Dm
People'd call, say, "Beware doll,
      Em                         F                 G
you're bound to fall" You thought they were all ...kiddin' you!

Pre-Chorus:
F             G
You used to - laugh about
F                  G
Everybody that was hangin' out
F       Em    Dm      C
Now you don't talk so loud
F       Em    Dm      C
Now you don't seem so proud

Dm                            F             G7
About having to be scrounging for your next meal!

Chorus:
            C    F   G  (G7)
How does it feel...?
            C    F   G  (G7)
How does it feel...?
                   C    F   G  (G7)
with no direction, home...?
                C    F   G  (G7)
Like a complete unknown...?
                     C    F   G  (G7)
Just like a rolling  stone?
