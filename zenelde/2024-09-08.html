[Intro]  (x4)
Asus2 Bsus2 Dsus2
 
[Verse]
    F#m                         Dsus2
I'm standing on the bridge, I'm waiting in the dark
  F#m                           Dsus2
I thought that you'd be here by now
        F#m                      Dsus2
There's nothing but the rain, no footsteps on the ground
    F#m                       Dsus2
I'm listening, but there's no sound
 
[Pre-Chorus]
E                        D
  Isn't anyone trying to find me
E                             D
  Won't somebody come take me home
 
[Chorus]
       Asus2 Bsus2 Dsus2
It's a damn  cold night
                 Asus2 Bsus2 Dsus2
Trying to figure out   this life
         Asus2            Bsus2         Dsus2
Won't you  take me by the hand, take me somewhere new
        F#m          E        D
I don't know who you are, but I,
         F#m       Dsus2           F#m         Dsus2
I'm with you______        I'm with you________ 
 
[Verse]
    F#m                      Dsus2
I'm looking for a place, I'm searching for a face
   F#m            Dsus2
Is anybody here I know
      F#m                       Dsus2
Cause nothing's going right and everything's a mess
    F#m                  Dsus2
And no one likes to be alone
 
[Pre-Chorus]
E                        D
  Isn't anyone trying to find me
E                             D
  Won't somebody come take me home
 
[Chorus]
 
       Asus2 Bsus2 Dsus2
It's a damn  cold night
                 Asus2 Bsus2 Dsus2
Trying to figure out   this life
          Asus2          Bsus2         Dsus2
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new
        F#m          E        D
I don't know who you are, but I
         F#m         Dsus2            F#m         Dsus2
I'm with you________         I'm with you________   yeah, yeah
 
[Bridge]
   E                         Bm
Oh,  why is everything so confusing
E                          Bm
  Maybe I'm just out of my mind
      E
Yeah, yeah, yeah,  yeah, yeah
D                         C#m    E
Yeah, yeah,  yeah, yeah,  yeah-eah-eah
