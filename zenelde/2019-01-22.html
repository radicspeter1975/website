[Intro]

Am G Am F Am
(Whistle)

Am G E Am

[Verse]
Am
Eead Love couldn't go no further,
Am
Proud of and disgusted by her,
Am
Push shove, a little bruised and battered,
G.               E                  Am
Oh Lord I ain't comin' home with you
Am
My lifes a bit more colder,
Am
Eead wife is what I told her,
Am
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder,
G                  E                Am
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

[Chorus]
Am
I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee, my squeeze.
                                                                     G
The stage it smells, tells, hells bells, mistells, knocks me on my knees
          Am                                                         F        Dm
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt, hang me from a tree
        Am                           E                          Am
After I count down, three rounds, in Hell ill be in good company

Am G E Am
