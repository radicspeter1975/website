[VERSE]
  F#5             B5
I declare I don't care no more
F#5                B5      E5      F#5
I'm burning up and out and growing bored
      B5         E5     C#5
In my smoked out boring room
F#5                 B5
My hair is shagging in my eyes
F#5                 B5      E5       F#5
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
          B5         E5        C#5
To drive along these shit town lights
 
[CHORUS]
B5              F#5
I'm not growing up
         B5  E5  F#5
I'm just burning out
      B5
And I stepped in line
   E5               C#5
to walk amongst the dead
 
[VERSE]
F#5        B5
Apathy has rained on me
F#5             B5     E5    F#5
Now I'm feeling like a soggy dream
            B5           E5      C#5
So close to drowning but I don't mind
     F#5               B5
I've lived inside this mental cave
F#5        B5     E5     F#5
Throw my emotions in the grave
          B5         E5  C#5
Hell, who needs them anyway
 
[CHORUS]
B5              F#5
I'm not growing up
         B5  E5  F#5
I'm just burning out
      B5
And I stepped in line
   E5               C#5
to walk amongst the dead
 
B5              F#5
I'm not growing up
         B5  E5  F#5
I'm just burning out
      B5
And I stepped in line
   E5               C#5
to walk amongst the dead
C#5
dead...
 
F#5  E5  F#5    x4
 
[CHORUS]
B5              F#5
I'm not growing up
         B5  E5  F#5
I'm just burning out
      B5
And I stepped in line
   E5               C#5
to walk amongst the dead
 
B5              F#5
I'm not growing up
         B5  E5  F#5
I'm just burning out
      B5
And I stepped in line
   E5               C#5
to walk amongst the dead
C#5
dead...
 
F#5  E5  F#5
