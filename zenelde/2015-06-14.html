Intro: E5 A5 Bb5 B5 C5 – E5 A5 Bb5 B5 C5 - E5 A5 Bb5 B5 C5
 
E5 F5
 
(whispered)Em F5
                                E5 
...And the road becomes my bride 
                                Bb5
I have stripped of all but pride
                  A5 
So in her I do confider
                          Bb5 
And she keeps me satisfied 
                E5 
Gives me all I need
E5                               Bb5 
...And with dust in throat I crave 
                          G5
Only knowledge will I save
                            Bb5 
To the game you stay a slave 
Rover wanderer 
Nomad vagabond 
 
Call me what you will, oh 
 
E5 A5 Bb5 B5 C5
 
F5                             E5 
  But Ill take my time anywhere 
                              Bb5 
Free to speak my mind anywhere 
And I'll redefine anywhere
A5
Anywhere I roam 
 
G5                             
Where I lay my head is home 
 
E5 A5 Bb5 B5 C5
 
(whispered)E5 F5
                                  E5 
...And the earth becomes my throne 
                      Bb5
I adapt to the unknown 
                             A5 
Under wandering stars I've grown 
                       Bb5 
By myself but not alone 
            E5 
I ask no one 
E5                              Bb5 
...And my ties are severed clean 
                               G5
The less I have the more I gain 
                           Bb5 
Off the beaten path I reign 
Rover wanderer 
Nomad vagabond 
Call me what you will 
 
E5 A5 Bb5 B5 C5
 
F5                             E5 
  But Ill take my time anywhere 
                              Bb5 
Free to speak my mind anywhere 
And I'll redefine anywhere
A5
Anywhere I roam 
 
G5                             
Where I lay my head is home

My body lie, but still I roam, yeah, yeah
