B                     B            Am          E
   Do you feel like a chain store? Practically floored
G              F    Bb               C#        
   One of many zeros, kicked around, bored
B                                B      Am               E
   Your ears are full but you're empty, holding out your heart
G                      F     Bb            A
   To people who never really care how you are

           C#m            B   A
So give me Coffee and TV, easily
     C#m              E
I've seen so much I'm going blind
        A                  B
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
C#m               B               A
Sociability, it's hard enough for me
C#m                    E
Take me away form this big bad world
     A             D                   A
And agree to marry me, so we can start over again

B                   B           Am         E
   Do you go to the country? It isn't very far
G                                F       Bb                 C#
   There's people there who will hurt you 'cause of who you are
B                              B                 Am                   E
   Your ears are full of their language; there's wisdom there, you're sure
G                       F       Bb                      A
   Till the words start slurring and you can't find the door

           C#m            B   A
So give me Coffee and TV, easily
     C#m              E
I've seen so much I'm going blind
        A                  B
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
C#m               B               A
Sociability, it's hard enough for me
C#m                    E
Take me away form this big bad world
     A             D                   A
And agree to marry me, so we can start over again

     C#m              E
I've seen so much I'm going blind
        A                  B

     A             D                   A
And agree to marry me, so we can start over again

B  D                    A
   Oh... We could start over again
B  D                    A
   Oh... We could start over again
B  D                    A
   Oh... We could start over again
B  D                    A
   Oh... We could start over again
