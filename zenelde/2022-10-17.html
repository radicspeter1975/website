Dm
 
[Verse 1]
Dm                         G                               Dm
Smack, crack, bushwacked.  Tie another one to the racks, baby.
Dm                       G                               Dm
Hey kids, rock and roll. Nobody tells you where to go, baby.
F                                 Am
What if I ride? What if you walk? What if you rock around the clock?
G
Tick,  tock,  tick,  tock.
Em                                                                  Dm
What if you did? What if you walk? What if you tried to get off, baby?
 
[Verse 2]
Dm                        G                               Dm
Hey kids, where are you?  Nobody tells you what to do, baby.
Dm                      G                                 Dm
Hey kids, shake a leg.  Maybe you're crazy in the head, baby.
F                                 Am
Maybe you did, maybe you walked.  Maybe, you rocked around the clock.
G
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
Em                                                                Dm
Maybe I ride? Maybe you walk? Maybe I drive to get off, baby.
