          Bb A                 Bb              A
 Hit it...  This ain't no discoand it ain't no country club
Bb A     E         
this L.A."All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die"

says the
C              D
man next to me out of nowhere
E
Apropos of nothing, he says his name's William but I'm sure he's
C             D         E
Billy, Mac or Buddyhe's plain ugly to me, and I
C                         D
wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his life
E
We are drinking beer at noon on a Tuesday
C                           D
in a bar that faces a giant car wash
E
The good people of the world are washing their cars
C                     D
on their lunch break, as best as they can in skirts and suits
Bb A
 They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Bb A
back to the phone company and the record store
Bb A
Well they're nothing like Bily and me,{soc}
                  E
cause all I wanna do is have some fun,
           C                        D
I've got a feeling that I'm not the only one,
            E
all I wanna do is have some fun,
           C                        D
I've got a feeling that I'm not the only one
            E
all I wanna do is have some fun,
          C                 D                 E   C  D
until the sun comes up over Santa Monica boulevard{eoc}
E
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
C                                           D
and Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottle of Bud
E
and shred them on the bar, then he lights every match in an

oversized pack
C                D
letting each one burn down to his
E                                                C D
thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
Bb A
and he's watching the Buds as they spin on the floor,
Bb A
a happy couple enters the bar dangerously close,
Bb A
the bartender looks up from his want ads{comment:Chorus}
Bb A
otherwise the bar is ours
Bb A
the day and thee night and the car wash too
Bb A
the matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
Bb A
the sun and the moon{comment:Chorus}

{ci:continue chorus, sometimes replace -Ive got a feeling Im not the

only one-}

{ci:with -I want to tell you the party has just begun-}

{ci:then fade-slowdown on the 
E - C - D 
pattern, and end on 
Bb A }
