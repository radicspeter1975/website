INTRO: F#m  C#m  F#m  C#m  D  E

(N.C.)
Oh you get me ready in your 56 Chevy 
Why don't we go sit down in the shade 
Take shelter on my front porch 
The dandy lion sun scorching, 
Like a glass of cold lemonade 

G         A          Bm              C#m
I will do laundry if you pay all the bills 

CHORUS: 
F#m         C#m
Where is my John Wayne 
F#m         C#m 
Where is my prairie son 
F#m         C#m 
Where is my happy ending 
D                  E
Where have all the Cowboys gone 

REPEAT INTRO

(N.C.)
Why don't you stay the evening 
Kick back and watch the TV 
And I'll fix a little something to eat 
Oh I know your back hurts from working on the tractor 
How do you take your coffee my sweet 
G      A                  Bm                 C#m  
I will raise the children if you pay all the bills 

REPEAT CHORUS

G               Bm           
I am wearing my new dress tonight 
                   F#m    C#m
But you don't even notice me 
D       E
Say our goodbyes (3 times) 

(N.C.)
We finally sold the Chevy 
When we had another baby 
And you took that job in Tennessee 
You made friends at the farm 
And you joined them at the bar 
Almost every single day of the week 
G               A            Bm            C#m
I will wash the dishes while you go have a beer 

REPEAT CHORUS

F#m         C#m
Where is my Marlboro Man 
F#m          C#m
Where is his shiny gun 
F#m         C#m
Where is my lonely ranger 
D                  E
Where have all the cowboys gone
