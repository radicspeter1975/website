[Verse 1]
G            Bm                 C
Theres no mistake, i smell that smell, its that time of year
G            Bm        C
again, i can taste the air
 
[Verse 2]
G          Bm            C
Clock goes back, railway track, something blocks the line
        G       Bm        C
again, and the train runs late for the first time
 
G, Bm, C
 
[Verse 3]
G       Bm      C
A pebble beach, underneath, pier just been painted
G             Bm       C
red, where i heard the news for the first time
 
[Chorus]
Em                               Dsus2
And all the friends lay down the flowers
                              Am7
Sit on the banks and drink for hours
                             C
Talk of the way they saw him last
                      G
Local boy in the photograph
Bm     C
Today
 
[Verse 4]
G            Bm  C                            G
He'll always be 23, yet the train runs on and on
         Bm          C
Past the place they found his clothing
 
[Verse 5]
G            Bm                 C
Theres no mistake, i smell that smell, its that time of year
G            Bm        C
again, i can taste the air
 
[Verse 6]
G          Bm            C
Clock goes back, railway track, something blocks the line
G              Bm          C
again, and the train runs late for the first time
 
[Chorus]
Em                               Dsus2
And all the friends lay down the flowers
                              Am7
Sit on the banks and drink for hours
                             C
Talk of the way they saw him last
                      G
Local boy in the photograph
Bm     C
Today
           G
He's gone away
