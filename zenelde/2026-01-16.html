[Verse 1]
Em
Hey, I'm in love
    G               A              Em
My fingers keep on clicking to the beating of my heart.
Em
Hey, I can't stop my feet,
G         A         Em
Ebony and ivory and dancing in the street.
Em  D/F#             G
Hey, it's 'cause of you,
     G              A          B
The world is in a crazy, hazy hue.
 
[Chorus 1]
    C                       G      D     Bm
My heart is beating like a jungle drum.
    C                       G      D     Bm
My heart is beating like a jungle drum.

My heart is beating like a jungle drum.
 
[Verse 2]
Em
Man, you got me burning
    G              A             Em
I'm in the moment between the striking and the fire
Em
Hey, read my lips
G                  A               Em
'cause all they say is kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Em D/F#          G
No, it'll never stop
     G               A               B
My hands are in the air, yes I'm in love
 
[Chorus 2]
    C                       G      D     Bm

My heart is beating like a jungle drum.

My heart is beating like a jungle drum.

My heart is beating like a jungle drum.
