[Verse 1]
      Em                                C
She’s got that kind of look that defies gravity
          Am                         C
She’s the greatest cook and she’s fat-free
      Em                                    C
She’s been to private school and she speaks perfect French
              Am
She’s got the perfect friends
         C
Oh isn’t she cool?
    Em                             C
She practises Tai-Chi, she’d never lose her nerve
                Am
She’s more than you deserve
           C
She’s just far better than me, hey hey
 
[Chorus]
G         D              Am        C
 So don’t bother I won’t die of deception
G                 D            Am              C
 Promise you will never see me cry, don’t feel sorry
G          D               Am             C
 And don’t bother, I’ll be fine but she’s waiting
G                     D                 Am
 The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
         Cm            Am
So don’t bother, be unkind.
 
G D Am C
 
[Verse 2]
    Em                                     C
I’m sure she doesn’t know who to touch you like I would
              Am                       C
I beat her at that one good, don’t you think so?
      Em                                   C
She’s almost six feet tall, she must think I’m a flea
             Am                        C
I’m really a cat, you see and it’s not my last life at all
 
 
[Chorus]
G         D              Am        C
 So don’t bother I won’t die of deception
G                 D            Am              C
 Promise you will never see me cry, don’t feel sorry
G          D               Am             C
 And don’t bother, I’ll be fine but she’s waiting
G                     D                 Am
 The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
         Cm
So don’t bother, be unkind.
