Felvezető dal: D C G (D)
<i>There are stars In the southern sky 
Southward as you go 
There is moonlight And moss in the trees 
Down the seven bridges road</i> 

Bm                        F#
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                      E
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
G                         D
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Em
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
F#
I had to stop for the night 
Bm                               F#
There she stood in the doorway,  I heard the mission bell
A                                          E
And I was thinking to myself this could be heaven or this could be hell
G                        D
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Em                                   F#
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say: Chorus

G                           D  
Welcome to the Hotel California
       F#                                            Bm 
Such a lovely place... such a lovely place... such a lovely face
G                                  D   [Fill 3]
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Em                                          F#
Any time of year... any time of year... you can find it here
