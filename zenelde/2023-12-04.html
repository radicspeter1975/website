a video fél hanggal mélyebben (D=C#)
[Intro]
D
 
[Verse]
D                     G7
The lunatic is on the grass
D                     G7
The lunatic is on the grass
D                     E7
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
A7                             D     Dsus2
Got to keep the loonies on the path
D                     G7
The lunatic is in the hall
D                      G7
The lunatics are in my hall
D                            E7
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
    A7                             D     Dsus2   D7  D7sus2
And every day the paper boy brings more
 
[Chorus]
G                          A
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
    C                            G
And if there is no room upon the hill
G                              A
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
     C                               G      Bm7  Em7  A7
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
 
[Verse]
D                    G7
The lunatic is in my head
D                    G7
The lunatic is in my head
D                  E7
You raise the blade, you make the change
A7                         D     Dsus2
You re-arrange me till I'm sane
D                     E7
You lock the door and throw away the key
        A7                              D    Dsus2   D7  D7sus2
There's someone in my head but it's not me
 
[Chorus 2]
G                        A
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
C                             G
You shout and no one seems to hear
G                                A
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
     C                               G      Bm7  Em7  A7
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
 
[Instrumental]
D    G7
D    G7
D    E7
A7   D  Dsus2
 
[Bridge]
<i>"I can't think of anything to say except...
I think it's marvellous! HaHaHa!"</i>
 
 
Eclipse
 
[Intro]
D   D9/C   Bb   A
 
[Verse]
D
All that you touch
D9/C
All that you see
Bb
All that you taste
A
All you feel
 
D
All that you love
D9/C
All that you hate
Bb
All you distrust
A
All you save
 
D
All that you give
D9/C
All that you deal
Bb
All that you buy,
     A
beg, borrow or steal
 
D
All you create
D9/C
All you destroy
Bb
All that you do
A
All that you say
 
D
All that you eat
D9/C
Everyone you meet
Bb
All that you slight
A
Everyone you fight
 
D
All that is now
D9/C
All that is gone
Bb
All that's to come
    A                    D
And everything under the sun is in tune
        D9/C                   Bb D
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon
 
[Outro]
<i>There is no dark side of the moon really
Matter of fact it's all dark</i>
