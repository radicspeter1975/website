[Intro]
A  F  C  D 

[Verse 1]
 A   C         D   G     A
  I bleach the sky every night
A  C        D         G            A
  Loaded on wrong and further from right
A C        D       G            A
  Spinning around, two howling moons 
A     C              D       G            A  F  C  D
  Cuz they're always there, whatever I do
A  F  C  D

[Verse 2]
A     C        D            G            A
  The river is loaded, I've been there today
A C            D          G            A
  Tool it some questions, she does me again
A     C           D       G             A
  I'd die in your arms if you were dead too
A C            D            G             A  F  C  D
  Here comes a lie, we will always be true

[Pre-Chorus]
Am    F       C      D
Going up when coming down
Am      F            C      D
Scratch away, way, way, way, way

[Chorus]
         Am     F           C      D
It's the little things that kill
Am      F     C      D
Tearing at my brains again
    Am     F           C
The little things that kill

The little things that kill
A  F  C  D

A  F  C  D

[Verse 3]
A  C          D    G          A
  Bigger you give, bigger you get
A       C        D         G             A
  We're boss at denial, but our best at forget
A  C          D         G            A
  Cupboard is empty, we really need food
A  C          D        G                A  F  C  D
  Summer is winter and you always knew

[Pre-Chorus]
Am    F       C      D
Going up when coming down
Am      F            C      D
Scratch away, way, way, way, way

[Chorus]
   Am     F           C      D
It's the little things that kill
Am      F     C      D
Tearing at my brains again
   Am     F           C      D
It's the little things that kill
Am      F     C      D
Tearing at my brains again
Am            F             C             D
Little little little little little little little little
Am            F             C             D
Little little little little little little little little

[Verse 4]
  Am           F         C        D
  I touch your mouth, my willy is food
  Am          F          C          D
  Addicted to love, I'm addicted to you shit
  Am         F        C        D
  I kill you once, I kill you again
  Am                 F       C          D
  We're starving and crude, welcome my friends to
  Am         F            C      D
  The little things that kill

(Keep doing) 
Am  F  C  D
