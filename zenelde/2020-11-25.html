fél hanggal mélyebben (E=Eb):

  E                                EEE A
  Hey honey whatcha trying to say
                                      AAA B
  As I stand here don't you walk away
          A                    E
  And the world comes tumbling down
 
                                 EEE A
  Hand in hand in a violent life
                                    AAA B
  Making love on the edge of a knife
          A                    E
  And the world comes tumbling down
 
           A
  And it's hard for me to say
           E
  And it's hard for me to stay
            A
  I'm going down to be by myself
            E
  I'm going back for the good of my health
              B
  And there's one thing I couldn't do
       A
  Sacrifice myself to you
       E
  Sacrifice
 
(solo)
E  A  E  A  B  A  E
 
E
  Hey baby I just can't see
A
  Just what you mean to me
E
  I take my hand and I fake my words
A
  I'm just your long-time curse
 
B                              A
  And if you walk away I can't take it
                              E
  But that's the way that you are
                                 A
  And that's the things that you say
                          E
  And now you've gone too far
                      A
  With all things you say
 
B
  Get back to where you come from
          A
  I can't help it
                  E
  Under the April skies
                  A
  Under the April sky
                  E
  Under the April sun
                  A
  Under the April sky
 
          E
  ooh-ooh-oooh
          A
  ooh-ooh-oooh
          E
  ooh-ooh-oooh
          A
  ooh-ooh-oooh
 
                  E
  Under the April sun
                  A
  Under the April sun
                  E
  Under the April sky
                  A
  Under the April sun
                  E    A
  Under the April sky
 
E
  Sun grows cold, sky gets black
          A
  And you broke me up and now you won't come back
  E
  Shaking hand, life is dead
        A
  And a broken heart and a screaming head
      E
  Hey hey
                  A
  Under the April skies
                  E
  Under the April sun
                  A    B   A
  Under the April sky
                  E
  Under the April sky
