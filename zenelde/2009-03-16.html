[Intro]
G     C     G     C
 
[Verse 1]
(C)            G
There's things I want
                 C
There's things I think I want
                    G
There's things I've had
                 C
There's things I wanna have
              Am
Do I want the dreams?
              F
The ones we're forced to see
 
[Verse 2]
                     G
Do I want the perfect wife?
              C
But perfect ain't quite right
               G
Shopping every day
                  C
Take it back the next break
             Am
They say the more you fly
    Am
The more you risk
     F
 
Your life
 
[Chorus]
         G   C
I'm just looking
        G  C
I'm not buying
         G   C
I'm just looking
            G  C
It keeps me smiling
 
[Verse 3]
            G
A house I've seen
          C
Another coulda' been
                G
You drenched my head
          C
And said what I said
              Am
You said that life is what
    Am
You make of it
    F
Yet most of us just fake
 
[Chorus]
         G   C
I'm just looking
        G  C
I'm not buying
         G   C
I'm just looking
            G  C
It keeps me smiling
 
[Instrumental]
 
C   G   C        G
C   G   Em D/F#  G
 
[Chorus]
         G   C
I'm just looking
        G  C
I'm not buying
              G   C
Well I'm just looking
            G   C
It keeps me trying
 
         G   C
I'm just looking
        G  C
I'm not buying
              G   C
Well I'm just looking
            G  C
It keeps me smiling
 
[Verse 4]
                 G
There's things I want
                 C
There's things I think I want
                   G
There's things I've had
                 C
There's things I wanna have
             Am
They say the more you fly
     Am
The more you risk
    F
Your whole life
 
[Slower Chorus]
         G   C
I'm just looking
        G  C
I'm not buying
         G   C
I'm just looking
            G   C
It keeps me smiling
