[Intro]
Eb
 
[Verse 1]
Eb                            Gm         Cm
You can't love me, you're not allowed to
                      Bb
'Cause if you did I'd probably run from you
Eb                           Gm           Cm
You can't hate me though you probably do
                         Bb
'Cause then I might just die and have to blame you
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Eb                        Gm          Cm
I can't breathe but maybe that's okay
                Bb
Maybe I'll just save it for another rainy day
Eb                      Gm             Cm
I can't sleep but maybe that's alright
 
I can save my sleeping for another empty night
 
[Chorus]
Ab             G    F              Eb
Kiss me at the red light one more time
Ab               G     F                Eb
Every time I think of you feels like a crime
Ab         G     F                    Eb
I could be green, red, orange, purple or blue
Ab      G   F                      Eb
Only if it means that I'm keeping you
 
[Verse 2]
Eb                               Gm      Cm
You gotta love me 'cause now you have to
                         Bb
And if you don't, well I might just have to kill you
Eb                              Gm      Cm
You can't forget me, I wouldn't let you
                          Bb
'Cause if you did I would run into the deep blue
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Eb                    Gm          Cm
I can't eat but maybe that's okay
                Bb
I can't save my eating for another weekday
Eb                           Gm           Cm
I can't cry but I guess it's for the best
 
Oh honey I can't take it, you're just better than the rest
 
[Chorus]
Ab             G   F              Eb
Kiss me at the red light one more time
Ab                G   F                Eb
Every time I think of you feels like a crime
Ab         G     F                    Eb
I could be green, red, orange, purple or blue
Ab      G   F                      Eb
Only if it means that I'm keeping you

I could be green, red, orange, purple or blue
Ab      G   F                      Eb
Only if it means that I'm keeping you
