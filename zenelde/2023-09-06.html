Capo: 1st (G=G#)

[Intro]
| G  | A | G  | A |
| Bm | E | Bm | E |
| Bm | E | Bm | E |
 
[Verse 1]
Bm
  Give me time to reason,
        E                       em
Give me time to think it through.
Bm
  Passing through the season,
        E           em
Where I cheated you.
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G                      A
  I will always have a cross to wear,
        Bm                          G
But the bolt reminds me I was there.
   E
So give me strength,
                          F#
To face this test of mine.
 
[Chorus]
                G          A
If only I could turn back time,
              G                   A
If only I had saved what I still had.
                G          A
If only I could turn back time,
        G             A                Bm  E
I would stay for the night... for the night.
 
[Verse 2]
Bm
  Claim your right to science,
           E
Claim your right to see the truth.
Bm
  Though my pangs of conscience,
             E
Will drill a hole in you.
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G                            A
  I've seen it coming like a thief in the night,
             Bm                                  G
I've seen it coming from the flash of your light.
   E
So give me strength,
                         F#
To face this test of mine.
 
[Chorus]
                G          A
If only I could turn back time,
              G                   A
If only I had saved what I still had.
                G          A
If only I could turn back time,
         Bm      C
I would stay.
 
[Bridge]
    Bm                             C
The bolt reminds me I was there
    Bm
The bolt reminds me I was there
 
[Chorus]
                G          A
If only I could turn back time,
              G                   A
If only I had saved what I still had.
                G          A
If only I could turn back time,
        G             A
I would stay for the night
 
                G          A
If only I could turn back time,
              G                   A
If only I had saved what I still had.
                G          A
If only I could turn back time,
        G             A
I would stay for the night
 
[Outro]
            G      A
If only I could
            G         A
If only I could
 
                G          A
If only I could turn back time,
        G             A
I would stay for the night
 
            G         A
If only I could
            G         A
If only I could...
