[Verse]
C
       Three important rules for breaking up:
C
   Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to
Prolonging the situation only makes it worse
C
 Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly
Don't make a big production
C
  Don't make up an elaborate story
This will help you avoid a big tear jerking scene
                               F#dim/C
If you wanna date other people say so
                                           B5
Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected
Even if you've gone together for only a short time
C
  And haven't been too serious,there's still a feeling of rejection
When someone says she prefers the company of others
     C
 To your exclusive company, but if you're honest, and direct,
                                                     C
And avoid making a flowery emotional speech when you break the news,
The boy will respect you for your frankness,
                                          F#dim/C
And honestly he'll appreciate the kind of straightforward manner
In which you told him your decision
              B5
Unless he's a real jerk or a cry baby you will remain friends!
 
[Chorus]
                Am             G
I'm head of the class, I'm popular
                  Am           G
I'm a quarterback,     I'm popular
                  Am             G
My mom says I'm a catch, I'm popular
               F                           C
I'm never last picked, I got a cheerleader chick
 
[Verse]
C
  Being attractive is the most important thing there is
If you wanna catch the biggest fish in your pond
C
  You have to be as attractive as possible
Make sure to keep your hair spotless and clean
C
  Wash it at least every two weeks, Once every two weeks!
And if you see Johnny football hero in the hall
F#dim/C
        Tell him he played a great game
             B5
Tell him you like his article in the newspaper
 
[Chorus]
              Am            G
I'm the party star, I'm popular
                Am           G
I've got my own car, I'm popular
               Am              G
I'll never get caught, I'm popular
                F                    C
I make football bets, I'm a teachers pet
 
[Verse]
C
  I propose we support a one month limit on going steady
C
  I think it would keep people more able to deal with weird situations
And get to know more people
C
  I think if you're ready to go out with Johnny
Now's the time to tell him about your one month limit
F#dim/C (B)
           He won't mind, he'll appreciate your fresh look on dating!
B5  (B)
        And once you've dated someone else you can date him again!
F#dim/C (B)
          I'm sure he'll like it! Everyone will appreciate it!
Gadd11(no5)/C
         You're so novel, what a good idea!
F#dim/C (B)
You can keep you time to your self!
B5  (B)
You don't need date insurance! You can go out with whoever you want to!
F#dim/C (B)                        B5  (B)
Every boy, every boy, in the whole world could be yours!
F#dim/C (B)                        B5
       If you'll just listen to my plan: THE TEENAGE GUIDE TO POPULARITY!
 
[Chorus]
                Am             G
I'm head of the class, I'm popular
                  Am           G
I'm a quarterback,     I'm popular
                  Am             G
My mom says I'm a catch, I'm popular
               F                           C
I'm never last picked, I got a cheerleader chick
 
[Chorus]
              Am            G
I'm the party star, I'm popular
                Am           G
I've got my own car, I'm popular
               Am              G
I'll never get caught, I'm popular
                F                    C
I make football bets, I'm a teachers pet
