[Intro]
D   G   x4
 
[Verse 1]
D                     G
When I met you in the restaurant,
D                       G
you could tell I was no debutante.
D                        A                       Em/bm?
  You asked me what's my pleasure, "A movie or a measure?"
                   G       A
I'll have a cup of tea and tell you of my...
 
[Chorus]
D         G
Dreaming, dreaming is free.
D         G
Dreaming, dreaming is free.
 
[Verse 2]
D                       G
I don't want to live on charity.
D                        G
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?
D                      A                       Em/bm?
Reel to reel is living rarity, people stop and stare at me,
                G   A               D
We just walk on by, we just keep on dreaming.
 
[Bridge]
G
Beat feet, walking a two-mile,
G
Meet me, meet me at the turnstile.
  D                   A
I never met him, I'll never forget him.
G
Dream, dream, even for a little while,
G
Dream, dream, filling up an idle hour,
D               A
Fade away, woo, radiate.
 
[Verse 3]
D                      G
I sit by and watch the river flow.
D                     G
I sit by and watch the traffic go.
 D                        A                           Em/bm?
Imagine something of your very own; something you can have and hold,
                    G    A
I'd build a road in gold just to have some...
 
[Outro]
D         G
Dreaming, dreaming is free.
D         G
Dreaming, dreaming is free.
D         G
Dreaming, dreaming is free.
D         G
          dreaming is free.
D         G
D         G
D         G
