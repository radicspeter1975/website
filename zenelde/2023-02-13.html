[Chorus]
D
  C                 G                             D
I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name

[Verse]
G5
Lost in a world with no reality
E5
I'm frightened to move
                  G5
I'm frightened to speak
                                   E5
And I will kill for a good night's sleep
                         G5    E5    G5    E5         D
I'm feeling, I'm feeling dead, dead, dead, dead

I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name
  C                 G                             D
I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name
  C                 G                             D
I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name
  C                 G
I think I've gone insane
 
[Outro]
G5
I can't remember

I can't remember
G5
I can't remember
G5
I can't remember
