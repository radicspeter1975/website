Lyrics:
(Verse 1)
Whatever she wants from me.
Whatever device.
Whether in kindness.
Whether in spite.

(Bridge)
What can I say?
What can I do?
I can't help myself.
I let the monster through.

(Verse 2)
Wherever she sends me.
Wherever the plain.
Perfect black dress.
Perfect grave.

(Bridge)
What can I say?
What can I do?
I did it to myself.
I did it all confused.

(Chorus)
Jesus online. 
Wires around the world.
Feel invincible.
Computer car and girl.
Jesus online.
Wires around the world.
Feel invincible.
To be perfect just like you.

(3rd Verse)
Whenever she comes with me.
Whenever we break.
Dress up my apathy.
Pretend we're great great great.

(Chorus)
Jesus online.
Wires around the world.
Feel invincible.
Computer carbon girl.
Jesus online.
Jesus online.
JESUS!
JESUS!
JESUS!

Jesus online.
Arms around the world.
Feel invincible.
To be perfect just like you. 
To be perfect just like you.
JESUS!
Jesus online.
JESUS!
To be perfect just like you.
To be perfect just like you.
To be perfect just like you.
To be perfect just like you.
Arms around the world.
(Perfect just like you)
