C                                     Em
There are nine million bicycles in Beijing 
         Dm           F
That's a fact, It's a thing we can't deny 
         Dm                G              C      C
Like the fact that I will love you till I die. 

                                          Em
We are twelve billion light years from the edge, 
         Dm                F
That's a guess, No-one can ever say it's true 
      Dm               G              C          C
But I know that I will always be with you. 

    Fm            C            G        Am
I'm warmed by the fire of your love everyday 
   Fm7             C          D                         G
So don't call me a liar, Just believe everything that I say 

          C                         Em
There are six billion people in the world 
        Dm           F
More or less, and it makes me feel quite small 
    Dm               G                C         C
But you're the one I love the most of all 

      Fm          C              G            Am
We're high on the wire, with the world in our sight 
    Fm7        C            D                           G
And I'll never tire, Of the love that you give me every night 
 
          C                        Em
There are nine million bicycles in Beijing 
         Dm           F
That's a Fact, it's a thing we can't deny 
         Dm               G               C        
Like the fact that I will love you till I die 

              Dm           G           C          
And there are nine million bicycles in Beijing 
        Dm               G        C
And you know that I will love you till I die!
