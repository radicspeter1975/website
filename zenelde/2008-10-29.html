<pre>
 We live in a greedy little world
 That teaches every little boy and girl
 To earn as much as they can possibly
 Then turn around and
 Spend it foolishly
 We've created us a credit card mess
 We spend the money we don't possess
 Our religion is to go and blow it all
 So it's shoppin' every Sunday at the mall

 All we ever want is more
 A lot more than we had before
 So take me to the nearest store

 Can you hear it ring
 It makes you wanna sing
 It's such a beautiful thing--Ka-ching!
 Lots of diamond rings
 The happiness it brings
 You'll live like a king
 With lots of money and things

 When you're broke go and get a loan
 Take out another mortgage on your home
 Consolidate so you can afford
 To go and spend some more when you get bored

 All we ever want is more
 A lot more than we had before
 So take me to the nearest store

 Can you hear it ring
 It makes you wanna sing
 It's such a beautiful thing--Ka-ching!
 Lots of diamond rings
 The happiness it brings
 You'll live like a king
 With lots of money and things

 Let's swing
 Dig deeper in your pocket
 Oh, yeah, ha
 Come on I know you've got it
 Dig deeper in your wallet
 Oh

 All we ever want is more
 A lot more than we had before
 So take me to the nearest store

 Can you hear it ring
 It makes you wanna sing
 It's such a beautiful thing--Ka-ching!
 Lots of diamond rings
 The happiness it brings
 You'll live like a king
 With lots of money and things

 Can you hear it ring
 It makes you wanna sing
 You'll live like a king
 With lots of money and things
 Ka-ching!
