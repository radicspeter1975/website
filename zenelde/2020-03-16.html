C                          G/B
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Am                            C  G
since you took your love away
C                        G/B
I go out every night and sleep all day
Am                             C  G
since you took your love away
C                                G/B
since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
Am                          C  G
I can see whoever I choose
C                                G/B               Am
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant - but nothing
                         E
I said nothing can take away these blues,
 
[Chorus]
      Bb          F
'cause nothing compares
   Bb        F       G
nothing compares to you
 
[Verse]
 
C                     G/B
It's been so lonely without you here
Am                         C    G
like a bird without a song
C                                         G/B
nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Am                                     C    G
tell me baby, oh where did I go wrong?
 
C                                 G/B
I could put my arms around every girl I see
Am                               C     G
but they'd only remind me of you
C                                     G/B
So I went to the doctor guess what he told me - guess what he told me
Am
he said boy you better try to have fun
                       E
no matter what you do,
 
but he's a fool
 
[Chorus]
   Bb          F
'cause nothing compares
    Am      G
nothing compares to you
 
[Instrumental]
C G/B Am C G
C G/B Am E
Bb F Am G Em G
 
[Verse]
 
C                                  G/B
All the flowers that you planted momma in the backyard
Am                      C G
all died when you went away
C                                     G/B
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
Am                                        E
but I'm willing to give it another try
 
[Chorus]
   Bb           F
'cause nothing compares
   Am        G
nothing compares to you  (x3 until fade)
  Em G
