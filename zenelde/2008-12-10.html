E       A                     B                     E
Oh my life is changing every day, in every possible way
E             A                           B
And oh my dreams, it's never quite as it seems
E
Never quite as it seems

E   A   B
I know I felt like this before, but now I'm feelin' it even more
E
Because it came from you
E   A   B
Then I open up and see, the person falling here is me
E
A different way to  be

G   C   G   C   E
Ah-ah-ah ah, ah-ah-ah ah

I want more, impossible to ignore, impossible to ignore
They'll come true, impossible not to do, impossible not to do

Now I tell you openly, you have my heart so don't hurt me
You're what I couldn't find
A totally amazing mind, so understanding and so kind
You're everything to me

Oh my life is changing every day, in every possible way
And oh my dreams, it's never quite as it seems
Cause you're a dream to me, dream to me dream to me
