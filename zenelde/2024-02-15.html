[Verse]
Am                 C        Dm            G
I reached inside myself and found nothing there to ease the 
Em             Am   G        F           D-F
Pressure of my ever worrying mind - Oh oh 
Am             C       Dm              G
All my  powers waste away, I fear the crazed and lonely 
Em                  Am      G       F           D-F
Looks the mirror's sending me these days - Oh oh 
 
[Chorus]
Em          Am-F  C              G
Touch me        , how can it be  -

Believe me      , the sun always shines on tv.  
Em          Am-F  C                   G
Hold me         , close to your heart -         
Em          Am-F   Am            G       F  G
Touch me       and give all your love to me

[Verse]
Am                  C     Dm               G
Please don't ask me to defend the shameful lowlands of the 
Em                 Am   G         F           D-F
Way I'm drifting gloomily through time - Oh oh 
Am                  C     Dm                    G
I reached inside myself today thinking there's got to be some 
Em              Am      G       F       Dm
Way to keep my troubles distant.        
 
[Chorus]
Em          Am-F  C              G
Touch me        , how can it be  -
