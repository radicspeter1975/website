Intro:
A5    B5    |C5    B5 G5 | (x3)

Verse 1:
A5                    B5
  As he came into the window
     |C5         B5       G5  |A5
Was a sound of a crescendo
                  B5
He came into her apartment
           |C5                 B5     G5  |A5
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
                       B5
She was sitting at the table
        |C5            B5    G5  |A5
He could see she was unable
                    B5
So she ran into the bedroom
       |C5                  B5        G5  |
She was struck down, it was her doom

Pre-chorus:

Will you tell us that you're OK
                     G5                  
There's a sign at the window
       |F5          \*(E5  G5  F5 G5) |A5   (\* or just G5)
That he struck you. A crescendo, An--nie
                  G5
He came into your apartment
           |F5                 G5      |A5
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
                      G5
Then you ran into the bedroom
        |F5                     \*(E5  G5  F5 G5) |   
You were struck down, it was your doom

A5                      B5
  So they came into the outway
       C5             B5        G5   A5
It was Sunday, what a black day
                  B5
I could've made a salutation
         C5                B5     G5
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

   Annie, are you OK

Will you tell us that you're OK
                     G5                  
There's a sign at the window
        F5          \*(E5  G5  F5 G5) A5   (\* or just G5)
