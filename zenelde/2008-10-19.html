INTRO

VERSE 1
D                                                  Am
I had visions I was in them I was looking into the mirror
                    C            C/B                    D
To see a little bit clearer, the rottenness and evil in me
D                                                             Am
Fingertips have memories mine can't forget the curves of your body
                      C          C/B                        D
And when I feel a bit naughty, I run it up the flagpole and see

Who salutes, but no one ever does

CHORUS
D                        C/A              C    Csus4           D
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and I'm so hot, cause I'm in hell

VERSE 2
Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding
The cretins cloning and feeding, and I don't even own a tv
Put me in the hospital for nerves and then they had to commit me
You told them all I was crazy, they cut off my legs now
I'm an amputee god damn you

CHORUS
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and I'm so hot, cause I'm in hell
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and it's a sin, to live so well

BRIDGE
A                G                       F
I wanna publish 'zines, and rage against machines
        D2/F#                                       A
I wanna pierce my tongue, it doesn't hurt, it feels fine
            G                             F
The trivial sublime, I'd like to turn off time
            D2/F#  D11/F#             D2/F#  D11/F#
and kill my mind,        you kill my mind

VERSE 3
Paranoia, paranoia, everybody's comin' to get me
Just say you never met me, I'm going underground with the moles (to get holes)
Hear the voices in my head I swear to god it sounds like they're snoring
But if you're bored then you're boring, the agony and the irony
they're killing me...woah

CHORUS
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and I'm so hot cause I'm in hell
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and it's a sin to live so well

    D   Am   C   C/B   C/A   Csus4   A   F   D2/F#    D11/F#
