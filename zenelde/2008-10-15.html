up we climb 
a boy named hellen 
up we climbed 
a girl called heaven 
the 1000 steps to greatness 
the 1000 steps to health 

take me to, take me to 
take me to... 
take me to rome in the rain 
have some of the best days in our lives 
let us be heaven in our hands 
can you feel anything? 
can you feel anything? 

standing still in blasphemic roads 
outbursts of laughter outbursts of insame 
must be genius creating the rain 
must be genius creating the rain 

back in rome 
when rome was in rain 
walk around 
like sparkling little wonders 
blow up the rain 
in blasphemic raincoats 

take me to, take me to 
take me to...take 
take me to rome in the rain 
have some of the best days in our lives 
let us be heaven in our hands 
can you feel anything?
