Csus2/4 C Csus2/4 C

[verse]
C           G/B     Am      F
   They say misery    loves company
C                  Em       Am              (G/B)
  We could start a company    and make misery

[frustrated]
C          G       F
Frustrated Incorporated

[prechorus]
F                    C
I know just what you need
F                     C
I might just have the thing
F                 C      G
I know what you'd pay to see

[chorus]
C      G         F
Put me out of my misery
    C         G              Am        F
I'd do it for you, Would you do it for me?
C       G      Am   F
We will always be busy
C  G   F
Making misery

[verse]
We could build a factory, and make misery
We'll create the cure, we made the disease

Frustrated Incorporated
Frustrated Incorporated

[prechorus]
I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to feel

[chorus]
Well, put me out of my misery
All you suicide kings and and you drama queens
Forever after happily making misery

[verse]
Did you satisfy your greed, get what you need?
Was it only envy? So empty.
