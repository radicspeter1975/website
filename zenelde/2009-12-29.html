1/2 hanggal mélyebben: C=B

Intro – C5 B5 E5  C5 B5 E5 3x
 
V1 - C5 B5 E5  C5 B5 E5
My reflection, dirty mirror
There's no connection to myself
I'm your lover, I'm your zero
I'm the face in your dreams of glass
 
Br1- E5
So save for prayers
For when we're really gonna need em
Throw all your cares and fly
Wanna go for a ride?
                          C5 B5 E5  C5 B5 E5
C1 - C5 B5 E5  C5 B5 E5
She's the one for me
She's all I really need  oh yeah
cause she's the one for me

E5                            E5
Emptiness is loneliness, and loneliness is cleanliness
E5
And cleanliness is godliness, and God is empty just like me
 
C5 B5 E5  C5 B5 E5
Intoxicated with the madness, I'm in love with my sadness
C5 B5 E5  C5 B5 E5
Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms
C5 B5 E5  C5 B5 E5
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth

Br2 – E5
I never let on that I was on a sinking ship
I never let on that I was down
 
Solo - C5 B5 E5  C5 B5 E5 4x
 
Br3 - E5
You blame yourself, for what you can't ignore
You blame yourself for wanting more
 
C5 B5 E5  C5 B5 E5
She's the one for me
She's all I really need oh yeah
She's the one for me
She's my one and only
