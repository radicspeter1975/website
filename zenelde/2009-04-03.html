[intro]

       E                             E
Well I woke up this morning stumbled out of my rack
  E                          E
I opened up the paper to the page in the back
   A                         A
It only took a moment for my finger to find
    E                      E
My daily dose of destiny, under my sign
   B                      B
My eyes just about popped out of my head
             E [stop]                            n.c.
It said "the stars are stacked against you girl, get back in bed"
 
       A     A       E       E
I feel lucky, I feel lucky, yeah
 B                      B
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way
E [stop]         n.c.            E   E   E   E
   Mmmmm, I feel lucky today    [instrumental]

Well I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk
The pot's eleven million so I called in sick to work
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's
Crossed against the light, made a beeline for the park
The sky began to thunder, wind began to moan
I heard a voice above me saying, "girl, you better get back home"

But I feel lucky, oh oh oh, I feel lucky, yeah
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away
Mmmmm, I feel lucky today
 
A    A    E    E      B    B    E    B
[Guitar solo]

E [stop]
Now eleven million later, I was sitting at the bar
(D)   E [stop]
I'd bought the house a double, and the waitress a new car
       A [stop]
Dwight Yoakam's in the corner, trying to catch my eye
(D)  E [stop]
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh
(A)    B [stop]                 B [stop]
  The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true
          E                      E7
Hey the stars might lie, but the numbers never do

I feel lucky, oh oh oh, I feel lucky, yeah 
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight
Hot dog, I'm feeling lucky tonight

I feel lucky, brrrrr, I feel lucky, yeah
Think I'll flip a coin, I'm a winner either way
Mmmmmm, I feel lucky today
E  E  E  E    A  A  E  E    B  B  E   n.c.      (F#9) (F9) E9           E
[piano solo]                      [piano break]            [crescendo]  [stop]
