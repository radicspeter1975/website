=======
verse:
------
the verse very simply goes like this (this is also the first thing you
hear when you play the song.  At times the other guitar comes in and
plays the same chord at a different spot on the fretboard. when that
happens, then you play the C#(I), the B(I), the G(I), and the F#(I)
progression while another guitar just plays the regular verse riff.
 
======================
verse riff: C#-B-G-F#
(you must play the C# and the C#(I), the B and the B(I), the G and the
G(I), and the F# and the F#(I) at the same time for the song to sound
right)
======================
 
when the other guitar comes in and plays the C#(I), the B(I) etc., you
could definately hear it in the begining and he plays this progression
at various places throughout the song.
 
Chorus:
-------
the chorus is pretty easy, it goes like this
F#-Bb-F#-Bb-A
 
rythem fill #1:
---------------
at .23 seconds, .47 seconds, etc. the guitar plays this,
it just slides down from a G to an F#:
it goes:
 
E|--------|
B|--------|
G|--------|
D|--5//4--|
A|--5//4--|
E|--3//2--|
 
\*\*another part of the song that occurs at 3.01 seconds in the song has the
  following progression
 
Bb-A-F#
 
the bass just plays the above progression (but if you wanted to you
could play along with the bass with an clean electric guitar).  A guitar
plays the below part a couple of times.
E|---------------------|
B|---------------------|
G|----------15---------|
D|------15-----15--13--|
A|--13-----------------|
E|---------------------|
 
bass guitar:
------------
this is played during the verse (when just the bass, drums and vocals are
going) and is played when the guitar plays the C#-B-G-F# progression
verse:
G|----------------------------|
D|----------------------------|
A|--4-4-4-2-2-2---------------|
E|--------------3--3-3-2-3-0--|
 
lyrics:
-------
could not believe
came here today
helmet was on
you blew me away
house is on fire
we're naked again
maybe all we need
is water and friends
 
shackless and chains
won't keep me away
temple is you
and my brow is insane
 
i wanna be just like you
i wanna feel right through you
i wanna see just with you
i wanna live
i wanna die
 
thinning ice
14 hairdryers
swimming to you
flame on earth desire
poor on the rise
rich on the fall
the cripple's with you
fame is a whore
 
i wanna fit inside you
i wanna room inside you
if money talks i wanna buy you
i wanna die
i wanna die
i wanna live you
 
i'm not scared of you
gave up on drugs
if i make it through
the jaws of love
jaws of love
 
you give
