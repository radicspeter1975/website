Intro:

E5 B5 A5 
 
E5
I spin off and lose my head
                              G5   A5
Throwing stray a spark instead
E5
Gather strength down in my heel
                              G5   A5
And dig it in the world I peel

E5                           B5 A5
Way down deep within my heart
E5                           G5 A5
Lies a soul that's torn apart
E5                                B5 A5 
Tell me, tell me what you're after
E5
I just want to get there faster
 
G5 A5 E5 G5 A5 E5 G5 A5 E5 G5 A5 E5 
 
I don't live - I inhale
I don't give - I unveil
Don't want to live in your misery
I don't live - I inhale
 
D5 – Em7
D5 – E5
 
E                              D
Sprinkle all my kisses on your head
E                             D
Stars full of wishes fill our beds
    E          D
She said, "I'm dead"
