<i>Stood still on a highway
I saw a woman
By the side of the road
With a face that I knew like my own
Reflected in my window
Well she walked up to my quarterlight
And she bent down real slow
A fearful pressure paralysed me in my shadow
She said 'son what are you doing here
My fear for you has turned me in my grave'
I said 'mama I come to the valley of the rich
Myself to sell'
She said 'son this is the road to hell'
On your journey cross the wilderness
From the desert to the well
You have strayed upon the motorway to hell</i>

Am
Well I'm standing by the river,
Dm
But the water doesn't flow.
F                   E
It boils with every poison -
        Am
You can think of.

Am
And I'm underneath the street light,
Dm
The delight of joy I know,
F                  E
Scared beyond belief,
                Am
Way down in the shadows.

C
And the perverted fear of violence,
G
Chokes a smile on every face,
F                         E
Common sense is ringing, out the bells.
Am                          Dm
This ain't no technological breakdown,
F                  E       Am
Oh-no, this is the road to hell.

Slide Solo

C
And as the roads jam up with credit,
G
And there's nothing you can do,
F
It's all just bits of paper,
E
Flying a way from you.
Am
Oh look out world take a good look,
Dm
Look who's down there,
F                                E            Am
You must learn this lesson fast, and learn it well.

Am                                   Dm
This ain't no upwardly mobile freeway,
F                  E
Oh-no, this is the road,
F           E
This is the road,
F           E        Am
This is the road ... to hell.
