A B C (Single notes)
I can’t help my feelings
A B C
I’ll go out of my mind
A B C
These players come to get me
A B C
’Cause they’d like my behind
A B C
I can’t love my business
A B C
If I can’t get a trick
A B C
Down on Santa Monica
A B C
Where tricks are for kicks
 
D (5 times)
Oh, come on and kick me
A B C  (4 times)
D                      F
Oh, come on and kick me
                        E
(Oh) Come on and kick me
                             D
(Oh) You’ve got your problems
                         C
(Oh) I’ve got my ass wipe
                       B
You got your big cheese
N.C.
I got my hash pipe
 
A  B  C (6 times)
 
A  B  C (same for each line)
I can’t help my boogies
They get out of control
I know that you don’t care
But I want you to know
The knee-stocking flavor
Is a favorite treat
Of men that don’t bother
With the taste of a teat
 
D (5 times)
Oh, come on and kick me
A B C  (4 times)
D                      F

                             D
(Oh) You’ve got your problems
                         C
(Oh) I’ve got my ass wipe
                       B
You got your big cheese
N.C.               G
I got my hash pipe

I’ve got my hash pipe
