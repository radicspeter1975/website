Fél hanggal mélyebben: A=G#
A   G               D
Devastation at last finally we meet
A     G                      D
After all of these years out here in the street
A     G                   D
I had a feeling you would make yourself known
A        G                   D
You came along just to claim your place on the throne
                Bm          F#m
Now I have been overthrown, overthrown

A             G                   D
And I thought If I told the right lines
                 A     G            D
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

Devastation my door was left open wide
You brought me into your heart then you swallowed my pride
I had a feeling you were hiding your thoughts
I made a not to myself, I merely forgot
Now I am overwrought, I'm overwrought

And I thought If I told the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine
And I thought If I told the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

Em                       F#m
One day this ground will break  
Em              F#m               Bm
and open up for me I hope it will I hope it will 

[solo see below]
E D A
E   D                A
Salutations at last, I'm down on my knees
I hear the bugle this morn blast Revile
Woke from a dream where I was in a terrible realm
All my sails were ablaze, I was chained to helm
f#m               c#m?
Now I am overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed

And I thought If I told the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine
And I thought If I told the right lines
But these mockingbirds won't let me shine

Solo: (half step flat also)
