It's how high you are and the time it takes to heal
It's how high you are and the time it takes to heal
 
Cadd9            G Em  F                   C
I can climb a tree and push up through the leaves
Cadd9                G Em  F               C
'Cause only when I try and am I happier to see
Cadd9                     G
My head's in some kind of space
      F       C
Where boyhood used to be
 
Cadd9           G               F              C
It's how high you are and the time it takes to heal
It's how high you are and the time it takes to heal
 
Cadd9          G   Em       F             C    Cadd9
But it's all a lie and I've never felt so sad  
                    G             Bm
There's a streak of melancholy
     F               D
It's running down my back
Cadd9               G
And there's a great mistrust
     F                  C
That boarders round the man
Cadd9     G                  F                          C
I call it strange from a boy who never (never) left his head
 
Cadd9           G               F              C
It's how high you are and the time it takes to heal
It's how high you are and the time it takes to heal

Yeah, yeah
         G     F C
Oh yeah, yeah

Am                 D               Fmaj7
And everyone needs someone to live by
Am             D               Fmaj7      Am   D
Everyone needs someone to live by
 
Cadd9          G    Em     F               C
But it's all a lie, it's a lie to make you beg
Cadd9         G Em                F                  C
For somethin' more, for somethin' better than you've had
Cadd9        G    Em    F      C
And I wish I knew
Cadd9        G      F      Em
Oh, I wish I knew...how to change
 
Am                    D               Fmaj7
'Cause everyone needs someone to live by
Am             D               Fmaj7
Everyone needs someone to live by
Am             Em              Fmaj7
Everyone needs someone to live by
               Em
Everyone needs someone

Everyone needs someone
