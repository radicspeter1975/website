Here's the chord voicings for Numb. Mute the A string when
playing the G chord by resting you index finger across it 
(which is on the big E string) mute the 3 high E, B and G
strings throughout. 
Move your index finger up to the D string to play the C chord. 
Play each chord and damp it suddenly to get the right sound - 
you'll also need distorsion, flanger and phaser for the guitar 
effects.

    G                   C              Em
E-----------------------------------|-------------------------
B-----------------------------------|-------------------------
G-----------------------------------|-------------------------
D---5--5---x-x---5--5---5-----5--5--|--9----------------------
A---X--X---x-x---X--X---3-----3--3--|--7----------------------
E---3--3---x-x---3--3---------------|--0----------------------

That's about it actually, a very minimalist song...

 NUMB
chords by: Bob Paley  

 G
Don't move, don't talk out of time, don't think,
                                   C
Don't worry everything's just fine, just fine
 G
Don't grab, don't clutch, don't hope for too much
                                                  C
Don't breathe, don't achieve, don't grieve without leave
 Em
Don't check just balance on the fence
                                                 C
Don't answer, don't ask, don't try and make sense

Don't whisper, don't talk, don't run if you can walk
Don't cheat, compete, don't miss the one beat
Don't travel by train, don't eat, don't spill
Don't piss in the drain, don't make a will
Don't fill out any forms, don't compensate
Don't cower, don't crawl, don't come around late
Don't hover at the gate

 Em
Don't take it on board
Don't fall on your sword
                       C                 (FAT LADY - Backing Vocal)
Just play another chord                         G
If you feel you're getting bored        I feel numb
                                                C
                                        I feel numb
 G                                      Too much is not enough
Don't change your brand                 Gimme some more
Don't listen to the band                Gimme some more
Don't gape                              Of that stuff love
Don't ape                               Too much is not enough
                    C
Don't change your shape, have another grape

                [Keyboard solo: D-C-D-C-Em-C]

Don't plead                             Too much is not enough
Don't bridle                            I feel numb
Don't shackle               I feel numb
Don't grind             Gimme what you got
Don't curve             Gimme what I don't get
Don't swerve                Gimme what you got
Don't lie, die, serve           Too much is not enough
                    I feel numb
Don't theorize, realise, polarise,
Chance, dance, dismiss, apologise
                    I feel numb
Don't spy               Gimme some more
Don't lie               Gimme some more
Don't try               Of that stuff love
Imply                   Gimme some more
Detain                  Too much is not enough
Explain
Start again             I feel numb

Don't triumph, don't coax, don't cling, don't hoax
Don't freak, peak, don't leak, don't speak

                                        I feel numb
Don't project               I feel numb
Don't connect, protect, don't expect
Suggest
                    I feel numb
Don't project, don't connect
Protect, don't expect, suggest
                    I feel numb
Don't struggle              I feel numb
Don't jerk, don't collar, don't work
Don't wish, don't fish, don't teach, don't reach

                    I feel numb
Don't borrow, don't break, don't fence
Don't steal, don't pass, don't press
Don't try, don't feel
                    I feel numb
Don't touch, don't dive, don't suffer
Don't rhyme, don't fantasize, don't rise
Don't lie
                    I feel numb
Don't project, don't connect
Protect, don't expect, suggest
                    I feel numb
Don't project, don't connect
Protect, don't expect, suggest          I feel numb
