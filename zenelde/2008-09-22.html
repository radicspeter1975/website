[Intro]
B C# E B
 
 
[Verse 1]
B                             C#
Woke up this morning and the streets were full of cars
E                                 B
all bright and shiny like they'd just arrived from mars.
                               C#
And as I stumbled through last night's drunken debris,
E                              B
the paperboy screamed out the headlines in the street.
 
F#m                      E
Another war and now the pound is looking weak
D                          C#m
and tell me have you read about the latest freak?
F#m                           E
We're bingo numbers and our names are obsolete
D                             C#
Why do I feel bitter when I should be feeling sweet?
 
 
[Chorus]
F#           D#m             A#m  C#
Hello, hello turn your radio on.
          F#                D#m
Is there anybody out there?
                A#m     C#
Help me sing my song.  
 
         G#m                      A#m
La la la life is a strange thing:
B                          C#
Just when you think you've learned how to use it
     F#
it's gone.
 
 
[Verse 2]
B                           C#
Woke up this morning and my head was in a daze.
E                              B
A brave new world has dawned upon the human race,
                                C#
where words are meaningless and everything's surreal.
E                                   B
Gonna have to reach my friends to find out how I feel.
 
F#m                      E
And if I taste the honey is it really sweet
D                       C#m
and do I eat it with my hands or with my feet?
F#m                 E
Does anybody really listen when I speak
D                         C#
or will I have to say it all again next week?
 
[Chorus]
F#                 D#m        A#m  C#
Hello, hello turn your radio on.
         F#                  D#m
is there anybody out there?
                A#m    C#
help me sing my song.
 
F#            D#m            A#m   C#
Hello, hello turn your radio on.
         F#                 D#m
is there anybody out there?
                   A#m    C#
Tell me: What went wrong? 
 
         G#m                     A#m     B    A#m
La la la life is a strange thing,
G#m                     A#m        B       C#
life is a strange thing.

         G#m                      A#m
La la la life is a strange thing

just when you think you've learned how to use it
     F#
it's gone...
