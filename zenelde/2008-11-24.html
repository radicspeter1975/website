A                                               G
A turn of the key And the door is pushed open, now 
A                                               G
He walks into the room But doesn't take off his coat 
A                                        G
Kisses me softly Without saying a word, now 
A                                                     G
There's that look in his eyes That makes me feel the cold 
C                                                  G
When I try to find out 'Bout what's troubling his mind 
C                                             G
He turns away and sighs And says give me some time 
C                                                 G
Maybe things would get better If I learned to be patient 
C                                 D
What I wanted was love Not an imitation 

And I know it 
                    G
We're heading for a fall 
      F
For a fall, 
                    G
We're heading for a fall 
                    F
We're heading for a fall 
                    G
We're heading for a fall 
G                                                F
We lie between sheets And he stares at the ceiling, now 
G                                            F
Me, I'm trying to sleep But I'm trembling inside 
G                                                F
If she's haunting his dreams Then why don't he say it now? 
G                                          F
Why stay if it's her that he wants in the end? 
A#                                       F
If he tried to explain I'd try to understand 
A#                                       F
Maybe I'd feel the same I'm not sure of myself 
A#                                       F
We surrended so soon In the arms of temptation, now 
A#                                 C
What I wanted was love Not an imitation 

And I know it 
                    F
We're heading for a fall 
      D#
For a fall, 
                    F
We're heading for a fall 
                    D#
We're heading for a fall
                    F
We're heading for a fall
