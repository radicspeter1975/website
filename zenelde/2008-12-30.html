I'm ahead, the man
I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah
I'm at peace with my lust
I can kill 'cause in God I trust, yeah
It's evolution, baby

I'm a beast, I'm the man
Buying stocks on the day of the crash
On the loose, I'm a truck
All the rolling hills I'll flatten them out, yeah
It's heard behavior, uh huh
It's evolution, baby

Admire me, admire my home
Admire my song, here's my clone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This land is mine, this land is free
I'll do what I want but i do irresponsibly
It's evolution, baby

I'm a thief, I'm a liar
Here's my church, and I sing in the choir:
Hallelujah, halleujah

Admire me, admire my home
Admire my song, admire my clothes
An appetite for a nightly feast
Those ignorant Indians got nothin' on me
Nothin', why?
Because, it's evolution, baby!

I am ahead, I am advanced
I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah
I crawled the earth, but now I'm hot
I tried to chill yah, but you turned to fire
It's evolution, baby {2X}
Do the evolution
Come on, come on, come on
