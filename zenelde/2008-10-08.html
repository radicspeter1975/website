CAPO - 1st fret (A=Bb)

A                          Dm
I can be an asshole of the grandest kind
A                              Dm
I can withhold like it´s going out of style
A                      Dm
I can be the moodiest baby and you´ve never met anyone
      A                     Dm
Who is as negative as I am sometimes

I am the wisest woman you´ve never met
I am the kindest soul with whom you´ve connected
I have the bravest heart that you´ve ever seen and you´ve never met anyone
who is as positive as I am sometimes

CHORUS:
   A                       D
You see everything you see every part
        A                     D
you see all my light and you love my dark
        A                   D
you dig everything of which I´m ashamed
            A                      D
There´s not anything to which you can´t relate
                A
And you´re still here

I blame everyone else & not my own partaking
My passive aggressiveness can be devastating
I´m terrified and mistrusting and you´ve never met anyone
who is as closed down as I am sometimes

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
E             D                 E            D
What I resist persist and speaks louder than I know
E                D               E          D
What I resist you love no matter how low or high I go

I am the funniest woman that you´ve ever known
I am the dullest woman that you´ve ever known
I´m the most gorgeous woman that you´ve ever known and you´ve never 
met anyone
who is as everything as I am sometimes

CHORUS
