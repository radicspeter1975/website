Capo 5

Intro:   [C] [Em] [C] [Em]

[Am]I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
I'll [Em]tell you that
but if [Am]I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
[Em]where's the sense in that?

I promise [G]I'm not trying to make your life harder
or re[Dm]turn to where we were [Em]

[F] but I will go down with this\_[C]\_\_ ship
and I won't [Dm]put my hands up and sur[Am]render
there will be [F]no white flag above my\_[C]\_\_ door
I'm in [G]love and always [Dm] will be

[Am]I know I left too much mess
and destruction to come [Em]back again
and I cause [Am]nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't [Em]talk to me again

[G]  and if you live by the rules of it's over
then I'm [Dm]sure that that makes sense [Em]

[F] but I will go down with this\_[C]\_\_ ship
and I won't [Dm]put my hands up and sur[Am]render
there will be [F]no white flag above my\_[C]\_\_ door
I'm in [G]love and always [Dm] will be

and when we [C]meet, which I'm sure we will
all that was [Em]then, will be there still
I'll let it [Dm]pass, and hold my tongue
and you will [G]think that I've moved on\_\_\_\_

[F] I will go down with this\_[C]\_\_ ship
and I won't [Dm]put my hands up and sur[Am]render
there will be [F]no white flag above my\_[C]\_\_ door
I'm in [G]love and always [Dm] will be

[F] I will go down with this\_[C]\_\_ ship
and I won't [Dm]put my hands up and sur[Am]render
there will be [F]no white flag above my\_[C]\_\_ door
I'm in [G]love and always [Dm] will be
