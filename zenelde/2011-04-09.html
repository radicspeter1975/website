Dm C C Dm C C
 
          Dm
You get a shiver in the dark
          C              Bb       A
It's been raining in the park but meantime
Dm                     C            Bb        A
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
F                              C
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
Bb                                          Dm   Bb / C
You feel all right when you hear that music ring
 
    Dm                  C         Bb       A
You step inside but you don't see too many faces
Dm                   C                Bb      A
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
F                                   C
Too much competition too many other places
Bb                                   Dm   Bb / C
But not too many horns can make that sound
             Bb / C                   Dm         C Bb C  Dm C Bb C
Way on down south   way on down south London town
 
              Dm           C / Bb        A
You check out guitar George     he knows all the chords
Dm                        C                  Bb      A
Mind he s strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
F                    C                Bb
And an old guitar is all he can afford
                                             Dm   Bb / C
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
 
    Dm            C       Bb         A
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
Dm         C       Bb               A
He's got a daytime job he's doing alright
F                                C
He can play honky tonk just like anything
Bb                      Dm  Bb / C
Saving it up for Friday night
               Bb / C                    Dm  C Bb C  Dm C Bb C
With the sultans     with the sultans of swing
 
      Dm                          C        Bb           A
And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
Dm                         C          Bb                A
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
F                                C
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
Bb                               Dm  Bb / C
It ain't what they call rock and roll
              Bb / C      Dm  C Bb C  Dm C Bb C
And the sultans    played Creole
 
Dm                  C           Bb        A
And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
Dm          C                Bb        A   A7
And says at last just as the time bell rings
          F                  C
thank you goodnight now it's time to go home
       Bb                          Dm   Bb / C
And he makes it fast with one more thing
                      Dm  C Bb C  Dm C Bb C
we are the sultans of swing
 
Dm  C Bb C  Dm C Bb C  x7
