I found a window in the kitchen, I let myself in
         G             Am   E                      F   C
rummaged through the refrigerator, poured myself a beer
         G         Am     E                     F       C
I cant believe I’m really here, and she’s lying in that bed
      G      Am       E                      F      C
I can almost feel her touch, and her anxious breath
          G      Am      E                    F      C
I stumble in her hallway, outside her bedroom door
           G        Am   E                        F    C
I hear her call out to me, I hear the fear in her voice
              G      Am     E                     F      C
she pulls her covers tighter, I press against the door
        G  Am  E      F    C
I will be with her tonight.
        G  Am  E      F   C
I will be with her tonight
