Fm                  C                 D7                G7

C               Cmaj7
  Bodies in the sand
Gm7                      F
  Tropical drink melting in your hand
Fm                    C                       D7
  We'll be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel drum band

Martinique, that Montserrat mystique
C                  Cmaj7

  And we'll perfect our chemistry
Fm                   C                  D7       G7
  By and by we'll defy a little bit of gravity
C              Cmaj7
  Afternoon delight
Gm7             F
  Cocktails and moonlit nights
Fm                         C                      D7
  That dreamy look in your eye give me a tropical contact high

  Way down in Kokomo
 
[Chorus]
