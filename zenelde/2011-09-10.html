capo on the 3rd fret
intro: G Em

G                Em
What's that they told you
        G               Em
about a book & a cover?
G               Em
Don't judge so quickly,
          G                     Em
Is it too much to remember?
                F
'Cause pictures lie,
        G
you know,
F
I'll show
        G
it's so.
                        Em
Just give it one thought.
 
What's that they taught you?
To revere a kind of beauty?
To paint on that pretty veneer
and try to hide whatever's dirty?
Well, faces lie.
You'll see
no sympathy.
Just give it one thought.
 
F               G                       Asus2
Come here and I will whisper true
            G/B             F
about the things I know of you,
                G
and you will recognize them,
Em  A
always...

F                  G                 Asus2    
As near to you as breath and bone,
           C              F
so dear to me, and yours alone,
               G
and I will love you for them,
Em  A
always...

What's that they tell you
about a book & a cover?
Don't judge so quickly.
They'll tell you one thing and then another.
But see what lies
within,
under the skin.
Just give it one thought.
