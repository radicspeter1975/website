Last night she said
            Dm  
Oh, Baby, I feel so down
        G
Oh, and turned me off
        Em        Dm
When I feel left out
   C
So I, I turned around
            Dm  
Oh, Baby, I don't care no more
       G
I know this for sure
       Em              Dm
I'm walking out that door

I keep walking for miles

 F                        G       
But the people they don't understand
 F                          G  
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
 F                         G 
Your grandsons, they won't understand
 F                                G
On top of this I ain't ever gonna understand

C
Last night she said
            Dm
Oh, Baby, I feel so down
         G
Oh, and turned me off
       Em         Dm 
When I feel left out
   C
So I, I turned around
               Dm
