Just an urchin livin' under the street
G                                  Bb
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
G                                              Bb
I'm your charity case, so buy me something to eat

Rags to riches, or so they say
G                                             Bb
You gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
G                                               Bb
You know, it's all a gamble when it's just a game
G                           C                             G
You treat it like a capital crime...Everybody's doin' the time

G                                           Bb
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
G                               Bb
Why I'm here I can't quite remember
G                                              Bb
The Surgeon General says it's hazardous to breathe
G                                       C
I'd have another cigarette, but I can't see
                          G
Tell me who you're gonna believe

Captain America's been torn apart
G                                        Bb
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart
G                                                  Bb
He said, "Turn me around and take me back to the start
G                   C
I must be losin' my mind" Are you, blind?
                           G
I've seen it all a million times
