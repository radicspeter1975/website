Intro: Am, Em, F, C, G x2  (play intro once before each verse)

Am                        Em
The future teaches you to be alone
    F                        C
The present to be afraid and cold
   F                 
So if I can shoot rabbits
C                    G        
Then I can shoot fascists

Bullets for your brain today
But we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper
Turns me into a gutless wonder

           Dm
And if you tolerate this
Am                         G
Then your children will be next
           Dm
And if you tolerate this
Am                         G
Then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next

Gravity keeps my head down
Or is it maybe shame
At being so young
And being so vain

Holes in your head today
But I'm a pacifist
I've walked La Rambas but
Not with real intent

And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next

Dm                 Am
And on the streets tonight
           G
An old man prays
     Dm           Am
With newspaper cuttings
             G
Of his glory days

And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next

Outro
Dm, Am, G, G x6
