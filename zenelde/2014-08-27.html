A  
Had it not been for Cotton-Eye Joe 
(If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe)
I'd been married long time ago
D
Where did you come from? Where did you go?
E
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

A
He came to town like a midwinter storm
D                             E  (v. A?)
He rode through the fields so handsome and strong
A
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
D                           E
But all he had come for was having some fun

Interlude(x2): A / D / B / E /

He brought disaster wherever he went
The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent
They all ran away so nobody would know
And left only men cause of Cotton-Eye Joe

A
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...
D                   E
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...
