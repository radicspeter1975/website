Riff: A G# F#

[Intro]
F#
Hey!
 
[Verse 1]
F#
I'm sick of seeing your face so much
F#
Television's off but you won't shut up
F#
Oh, oh, give it up
F#
Aren't you really tired of taking your clothes off
F#
Making people think that you're so tough
F#
Oh, oh, give it up
 
[Pre-chorus]
F#5   E5  D#5   D5
Please, please...
 
[Chorus]
           E                                            D
Nothing is changing I keep hearing the same thing over again
               E                                                     D
It's not about hating, I'm just sick of this faking and I want it to end
 
[Verse 2]
F#
I know that you're never gonna get in love
F#
You're not the kind of person I get on top of
F#
Oh, oh, give it up
 
F#
I think that it's time for you to move along
F#
Or you're gonna burn up in my sweet napalm
F#
Oh, oh, give it up
 
F#   E5  D#5   D
Please, please...
 
[Chorus]
           E                                            D
Nothing is changing I keep hearing the same thing over again
               E                                                     D
It's not about hating, I'm just sick of this faking and I want it to end
 
        E
Give it up, I've had enough
        D
Give it up, give it up
        E
Give it up, I've had enough
        D
Give it up, give it up
 
           E                                           D
Nothing is changing I keep hearing the same thing over again
               E                                                     D
It's not about hating, I'm just sick of this faking and I want it to end
 
F#
Hey!
 
N.C. (end)
Hey!
