[Intro]:
Ab  E  Db (x4)
 
[Verse 1]
       Ab                     E   Db
Well nobody wants to burn in hell
          Ab                   E   Db
But everybody's got a soul to sell
            Ab                           E   Db
When I was young my mama gave me some advice
          Ab                      E             Db
She said boy don't you know everybody's got a price?
 
[Chorus]
   Ab                              E         Db
I make lots of money, I make more money than you
          Ab                          E             Db
I drive around in my limo that's what I was born to do
        Ab                          E         Db
And I might like you better if we fought together
       Ab                                E        Db
If its not to be noted I got somethin' better for ya
