[Intro] és végig:
 
F C Am G x4
 
[Verse 1]
F C Am G
Well, I started out,
down a dirty road.
Started out,
all alone.
 
[Verse 2]
And the sun went down,
as I crossed the hill.
And the town lit up,
the world got still.
 
[Chorus]
I'm learning to fly,
but I ain't got wings.
Coming down,
is the hardest thing.
 
[Verse 3]
Well the "Good old days"
may not return.
And the rocks might melt,
and the sea may burn.

[Chorus]
I'm learning to fly, (learning to fly)
but I ain't got wings. (learning to fly)
Coming down, (learning to fly)
is the hardest thing. (learning to fly)
 
G G

[Solo]
F C Am G x4
 
[Verse 4]
Well, some say life,
will beat you down.
Break your heart,
steal your crown.
 
[Verse 5]
So I started out,
for God knows where.
I guess I'll know,
when I get there.
 
[Chorus]
I'm learning to fly,
around the clouds,
What goes up, (learning to fly)
must come down.

G G
 
[Instrumental]
F C Am G x2
 
[Chorus]
I'm learning to fly, (learning to fly)
but I ain't got wings.
Coming down,
is the hardest thing.
 
I'm learning to fly, (learning to fly)
around the clouds,
What goes up, (learning to fly)
must come down.
 
[Outro]
I'm learning to fly, (learning to fly)
 (learning to fly)
I'm learning to fly, (learning to fly)
 (learning to fly)
 (learning to fly)
 (learning to fly)
 
(fade out)
