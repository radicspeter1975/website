[Intro]
D  G     G F# E A
D  G     G F# E A
 
[Verse 1]
D               G       G  F#  E  A
I don't want to be crippled and cracked
D               G       G  F#  E  A
Shoulders  and  wrists, knees and back
D               G       G  F#  E  A
Ground          to      dust and ash
D               G       G  F#  E  A
Crawling        on      all fours
 
[Chorus]
            E      F#m     G       A
When you've got to feel it in your bones
            E      F#m     G       A
When you've got to feel it in your bones
 
[Verse 2]
D               G       G  F#  E  A
Now             I       can't climb the stairs
D               G       G  F#  E  A
Pieces          missing everywhere
D               G       G  F#  E  A
Pro     -       zak     painkillers
 
[Chorus]
            E      F#m     G       A
When you've got to feel it in your bones
            E      F#m     G       A
When you've got to feel it in your bones
 
[Verse 3]
D               G       G  F#  E  A
I   used  to    fly     like Peter Pan
D               G       G  F#  E  A
All the children flew when I touched their hands
 
[Chorus]
                E      F#m     G       A
You see, you've got to feel it in your bones
                E      F#m     G       A
You see, you've got to feel it in your bones
                E      F#m     G       A
Eh-eh
                E      F#m     G       A
(stammered)     E      F#m     G       A
(stammered)     E      F#m     G       A
