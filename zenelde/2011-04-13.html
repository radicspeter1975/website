D G x4
                   D                                               G
Well I was watching this talk show the other day
             D                                G        
And on it there was this guy and he was saying
                      D                          G
« When you let other people tell you what's right
                   D                                               G
When you leave your instinct and your own truth behind », he said : 
D                         G
« That's a virus of the mind,
D                         G
   That's a virus of the mind »
           D                                  G
Well I guess it's kinda like losing your sight
          D                                            G
For a second you think that they might be right
           D                                           G
And it feeds the doubts that you have inside
   D                          G
It almost starts to feel like a crime
     D                          G
To follow your own rhythm and rhyme

D       A              G     Asus4
   I'm pretty happy, living in my
D        A                 G        A sus4
   My own sweet time, living in my
D        A              G           Asus4
   I'm pretty happy, and I don't need your
A7~                             D         G
   Virus of the mind
D          G                   D        G   D   G
     Your virus of the mind

Well I went to this party thing last night
A lot of people I hadn't seen in a long, long time
And they wanted to know about my life
But making me feel like it wasn't quite right
Like « Where's is your kids ? » and « Where is you car ? »
I said « I don't have either but I have a guitar »
And I ended up feeling like I was a freak
So I found some wine and something to eat 
I talked to the dog to pass the time
I told myself « I'm doing just fine »
It's just a virus of the mind, it's just a virus of the mind

I'm pretty happy, living in my
My own sweet time, living in my
I'm pretty happy, and I don't need your
 Virus of the mind
D          G                   D        G   D   G
     Your virus of the mind

It's in the deep of your soul, it's on the tip of your tongue
It's the feeling you get, when you feel young
It's in the sound of a beat, it's in the base of your spine
It's in your gut reaction, yeah every time
But they tell you what you should have, they tell you who you should be
It's in the pictures and ads and in the magazines
I'm kicking it off like a bug in the breeze
Cause is anyone out there inside me
I say « Is anyone out there inside me ? », I say : « Is anyone ? »

Em A

I'm pretty happy, living in my
My own sweet time, living in my
I'm pretty happy, and I don't need your
