D       A              Em
Chemicals will hit you
        Bm                D
Chemicals will knock you down
       A
Is it over cause you
     Em
You feel no pain
  G
Throwning me around
D              A
You attack my head
              Em
With numbers
               Bm
You attack my room
                D
With things of glass
                A
You attack my neighbors
           Em
'Till you find someone
         G
Who's cleaning up the mess
D           A
You are no good
Bm          A
You are no good
          Em             F#m
'Cause I know you can't sleep
           G
'Till you know your overbearance
Makes me creep

D           A
You are no good
Bm          A
You are no good
          Em              F#m
'Cause I know you can't sleep
           G
'Till you know your overbearance
           D
Makes me creep
