fél hanggal mélyebben: B=Bb

Bm   A       G              E
Like his dad you know that he's had
Bm         A       G         A
animal nitrate in mind
              Bm     A       G              E
Oh in your council home he jumped on your bones
            Bm         A         G
now you're taking it time after time

                 D   G    D   G     Bm  A       G
Oh it turns you ooo-oon, ooo-oon... now he has gone
                   D   G    D   G     Bm       A       E
Oh what turns you ooo-oon, ooo-oon, now your animal's gone?

     Bm   A       G              E
Well he said he'd show you his bed
           Bm               A       G       A
and the delights of the chemical smile
            Bm      A       G              E
So in your broken home he broke all your bones
                 Bm        A         G
and now you're taking it time after time

                 D   G    D   G     Bm  A       G
Oh it turns you ooo-oon, ooo-oon... now he has gone
                   D   G    D   G     Bm  A       G
Oh what turns you ooo-oon, ooo-oon, now your animal's gone?

                               D   G    D   G     Bm  A       G
What does it take to turn you ooo-oon, ooo-oon... now he has gone?
                       D   G    D   G   Bm        A       G
now you're over twenty-oo-one, oo-one? now your animal's gone?
      D      G      D   G     Bm  A       G
...Animal, he was animal, an animal...
