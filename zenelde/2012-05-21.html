F5  Bb5  G5  C5   (drums + guitar + bass + piano riff1)
[Verse] (bass only)
F5       Bb5              G5
Longing for the schoolyard reaching for the scenes 
        C5
reminded by the songs that will never disappear
F5       Bb5             G5
Random like the infants outdated like the old
        C5
lying there in aimlessness listening to the 
Riff2 (guitar verse)

[Pre-Chorus] (play riff2 2x)
F5          Bb5             G5
cure  doing some rehearsal exercising in the cold
       C5
lowering the standard for the six-string never
F5             Bb5            G5
rolled whistling at the girls and saving for the fuel
         C5
making plans and knock knock knock on wood

[Chorus] (distortion & piano riff)
F5        Bb5       G5         C5      ( D5 ) ( E5 )
Play some rock Play some rock Please don´t stop Coming home coming home
F5        Bb5       G5         C5      ( D5 ) ( E5 )
Play some rock Play some rock Please don´t stop Coming home coming home

[Verse] (bass only)
F5        Bb5             G5
Sentenced by our faults we were to make in time
      C5
pleasently aware of our solitude in mind
F5        Bb5         G5
Saved me from the boredom of what we disavowed
         C5
encouraged by the sound that was the sweetest one of all

[Pre-Chorus] (play riff2 2x)
F5       Bb5             G5
Admiring your senses infected by your tongue
       C5
defenceless I believed that we´d face anything to come
F5       Bb5              G5
You innocently told me you´d catch me when I fall
         C5
and solemnly we´d knock knock knock on wood

[Chorus] (distortion & piano riff)
F5        Bb5       G5         C5      ( D5 ) ( E5 )
Play some rock Play some rock Please don´t stop Coming home coming home
F5        Bb5       G5         C5      ( D5 ) ( E5 )
Play some rock Play some rock Please don´t stop Coming home coming home

[Bridge] (distortion)
A5        C5          F5       [nc]
I´m not the only one  I´m not the only one     I´m not the only one
A5        C5          F5       [nc]
I´m not the only one  I´m not the only one     I´m not the only one
A5        C5
I´m not the only onehhhhhonee

[Chorus] (distortion & piano riff)
F5        Bb5       G5         C5      ( D5 ) ( E5 )
Play some rock Play some rock Please don´t stop Coming home coming home
F5        Bb5       G5         C5      ( D5 ) ( E5 )
Play some rock Play some rock Please don´t stop Coming home coming home
F5        Bb5       G5         C5      ( D5 ) ( E5 )
Play some rock Play some rock Please don´t stop Coming home coming home
F5        Bb5       G5         C5 C5 C5  ( D5 ) ( E5 )
Play some rock Play some rock Please don´t stop
