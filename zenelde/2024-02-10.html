[Intro]
E C E C E C E C
 
[Verse 1]
E      C         E      C  E           E7          D   C  G
Nothing seems to kill me     no matter how hard I try
F#                     F#   B  G
  Nothing's closing my eyes
C                        Am7                   F#        B  A  F#
  Nothing can bring me down for your pain or delight   No
 
[Verse 2]
E      C         E       C   E           E7         D    C  G
Nothing seems to break me      no matter how hard I fall
F#                        F#   B  G
  Nothing can break me at all
C                       Am7                       F#      A
  Not one for giving up     though I'm not invincible   I know
 
[Chorus]
     A                  C                              B
I've given everything I need I'd give you everything I own
                            G       C#     A
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
A                       C                         F#
I've given everything I could to blow it to hell and gone
                   E           C
Burrow down in and blow up the outside
E           C
Blow up the outside
E           C       E     D
Blow up the outside world
 
[Verse 3]
E      C         E              C
Someone tried to tell me something
E               E7              D    C  G
  Don't let the world bring you down
F#                              B  G C
  Nothing can do me in before I do myself
C                         Am7                      F#        A
  So save it for your own     and the ones you can help   no-ooo
 
[Chorus]
 
     A                  C                              B
I've given everything I need I'd give you everything I own
                            G       C#     A
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
A                       C                         F#
I've given everything I could to blow it to hell and gone
                   E           C
Burrow down in and blow up the outside
E           C
Blow up the outside x2

Blow up the outside world
