[Intro]
D   G   A
D   G   A
 
[Verse 1]
D                            G
It's hard to remember how it felt before,
A                          D
Now I found the love of my life...
                       G
Passes things get more comfortable,
A                   G
Everything is going right.
 
[Verse 2]
                  A
And after all the obstacles,
             D                Dmaj7         G
It's good to see you now with someone else.
                A            D              Dmaj7
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends.
      G                   A -single strum
After all that we've been through,
                 D                        G  A
I know we're cool.       I know we're cool.
 
[Verse 3]
D                       G
We used to think it was impossible,
        A                      D
Now you call me by my new last name.
                      G
Memories seem like so long ago,
A                     G
Time always kills the pain.
 
[Verse 4]
                A
Remember Harbor Boulevard?
    D                       Dmaj7          G
The dreaming days where the mess was made.
                 A
Look how all the kids have grown,
D                          Dmaj7
We have changed, but we're still the same.
      G                   A -single strum
After all that we've been through,
                 D                      G  A
I know we're cool.     I know we're cool.   
D                            G  A
     Yeah....I know we're cool.
 
[Verse 5]
G                A                   D        Dmaj7
And I'll be happy for you if you can be happy for me.  
G           A                        D                         Dmaj7
Circles and triangles, and now we're hangin' out with your new girlfriend,
   G                    A -single strum
So far from where we've been,
 
[Outro]
                 D                      G  A
I know we're cool.     I know we're cool.   
       D                                  G  A             D
 Co OO ol,      uh, uh...I know we're cool.       Uh,uh.
                     G                D
Uh...I know we're coOol.        Co OO ol,      yeah,   
                 G   A
I know we're cool.
        D (fading out...)  G     D
You know...
