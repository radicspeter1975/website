G                       D   
So long ago I don't remember when 
        F#                            Bm
That's when they say I lost my only friend
           G                         D
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
      F#                          Bm
As I listen through the cemetary trees

         G                          D
I seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn
    F#                      Bm
of long broken arm of human law
         G                           D
Now it always seem such a way she always had a pretty face
       F#                             Bm    G  
I wondered when she hung around this place
F#
Hey, hey, heeehy...

Chorus

 G
Come on try a little
D
Nothin' is forever
Em                          A       
There's gotta be somethin' better than in the middle
G                 D     
Me an Cinderella, put it all together
Em
We can drive it home
A                G D Em A G 
With one headlight
