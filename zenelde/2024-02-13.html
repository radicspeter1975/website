[Verse 1]
D               Em              C
Did you see the sky i think it means that we've been lost
D               Em              C
Maybe one less time is all we need
D                  Em        C
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
D               Em                 C
Jumpin' off a bridge is just the farthest that i've ever been
 
[Chorus]
G            Em        C            (Riff walk from C to D)
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
D             Em              C   (Riff walk from C to G)
Anyplace but those i know by heart
G            Em         C
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
D                Em                C
i'll follow you down but not that far
 
D-Em-C x1
 
[Verse 2]
D                     Em              C
I know we're headed somewhere i can see how far we've come
D                    Em        C
But still i can't remember anything
D                Em                C
Lets not do the wrong thing and i swear it might be fun
D                 Em             C
It's a long way down but all the knots we've tied have come undone
 
[Chorus]
G            Em        C            (Riff walk from C to D)
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
D              Em              C   (Riff walk from C to G)
Anyplace but those i know by heart
G            Em         C
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
D                Em                C
i'll follow you down but not that far
 
[Solo]
Same pattern as verses

[Verse 3]
D              Em            C
How you gonna ever find your place
D             Em         C
Runnin' in an artificial pace
D              Em            C
Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand
D                 Em         C
So what the hell, have we already been forever damned?
 
[Chorus]
G            Em        C            (Riff walk from C to D)
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
D             Em              C   (Riff walk from C to G)
Anyplace but those i know by heart
G            Em         C
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
D                Em                C
i'll follow you down but not that far
 
[Chorus]
G            Em        C            (Riff walk from C to D)
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
D             Em              C   (Riff walk from C to G)

Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
D                Em                C
i'll follow you down but not that far
D                Em                 C
I'll follow you down, but not that far (follow you down)
D                Em                 C
I'll follow you down, but not that far (follow you down)
D                Em                 C
I'll follow you down, but not that far (follow you down)
