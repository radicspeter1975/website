Intro:
G   D   C   D  Em  D  Em  D  C  D  C  D

G         D            C
   My name is Luka
              D                 G
I live on the second floor
        D                      C
I live upstairs from you
              D                        Em  
Yes I think you've seen me before
             D                          Em
If you hear something late at night
             D                        C
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
                 D                C
Just don't ask me what it was 
               D                C
Just don't ask me what it was  
               D (hit it twice)
Just don't ask me what it was

G          D                          C
   I think it's because I'm clumsy
             D                G
I try not to talk too loud
             D                 C
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
             D               Em
I try not to act too proud
          D                     Em
They only hit you until you cry
          D                      C
And after that you don't ask why
               D               C
You just don't argue anymore
               D               C
You just don't argue anymore
               D (hit it twice again)

   Yes I think I'm OK
                  D            G
I walked into the door again
              D                          C
Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
                  D                 Em
And it's not your business anyway
            D                   Em
I guess I'd like to be alone
             D                     C
With nothing broken, nothing thrown
           D                C
Just don't ask me how I am
           D                C
Just don't ask me how I am
           D (hit it twice)
Just don't ask me how I am
