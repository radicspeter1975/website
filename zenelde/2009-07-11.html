Intro: Bm, E, Bm, E

Verse:
A              D
Everything is open
E                 Esus E
Nothing is set in stone
A               D
Rivers turn to ocean
E               Esus E
Oceans tide you home
A                  D
Home is where your heart is
    E                  Esus E
But your heart had to roam
A             D
Drifting over bridges
E
Never to return
E7
Watching bridges burn

Chorus:
       A         E              D
You're driftwood floating underwater
                Bm
Breaking into pieces pieces pieces
     A         E              D
Just driftwood hollow and of no use
                Bm
Waterfalls will find you bind you grind you

Verse:
Nobody is an island
Everyone has to go
Pillars turn to butter
Butterflying low
Low is where your heart is
But your heart has to grow
Drifting under bridges
Never with the flow

Bridge:
          Bm                          E
And you really didnt think it would happen
         Bm                      E
But it really is the end of the line
        A   E                  D
So I'm sorry that you turned to driftwood
                Bm                        A  
But you've been drifting for a long long time

Bm, A - Play 4 times.

Verse:
Everywhere theres trouble
Nowheres safe to go
Pushes turn to shovels
Shovelling the snow
Frozen you have chosen
The path you wish to go
Drifting now forever
And forever more
Until you reach your shore

Chorus:
...
             Bm
Youve been drifting for a long long
D                         A -- Fadeout
Drifting for a long long time
