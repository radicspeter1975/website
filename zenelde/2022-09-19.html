[Verse 1]
        C                G           C             F
Am I dreamin', or stupid, I think I've been hit by Cupid
     C    G        F      G     C
But no one needs to know right now
           C                 G
I met a tall dark and handsome man
C                         F
and I've been busy makin' big plans
     C    G        F      G     C
But no one needs to know right now
             C          G           C             F
I got my heart set, my feet wet and he don't even know yet
     C    G        F      G     C
But no one needs to know right now
 
[Chorus]
                F                    C
I'll tell him some day some way some how
              Am         F         G
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now
 
[Verse 2]
          C                G
I want the bells to ring a choir to sing
 C                                                   F
The white dress, the guests, the cake, the car, the whole darn thing
     C    G        F      G     C
But no one needs to know right now
 
[Chorus]
                F                    C
I'll tell him some day some way some how
             Am         F         G
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now
 
[Verse 3]
                  C           G               C                F
We'll have a little girl, a little boy, a little bengi we call Leroy
     C    G        F      G     C
But no one needs to know right now
 
[Bridge]
            Am     F    C               G
And I'm not lone -  ly, anymore at night
            Am     F            C               G
and he don't know only only,  he can make it right

        D         A               D        (A)     G
Am I dreamin', or stupid, but boy I've been hit by Cupid
       D        A           G      A     Bm    G
