E  B               F#                       E                    
   This wrinkle in time, I can't give it no credit
E                  F#          B             F#    
I thought about my space and I really got me down (got me down)
B         F#               E
Got me so down, I got me a headache
E                         F#             B                  F#
My heart is crammed in my cranium and it still knows how to pound 
E                  F#
I was counting the rings
G#                A
   And I fell me into sleep
A            B      C#       D#        E\* E
 I peeked to see if you were way back when
E                  F#
I was counting the trees
G#                A         
 Until a day when there was one
            B       C#         D#                E\*  E  D#
I'd hoped beneath, asleep is where that you had been
B               F#                       E
This wrinkle in time, I can't give it no credit
E                   F#          B             F#
 I thought about my space and I really got me down (got me down)
B          F#               E
 Got me so down, I got me a headache
   E                      F#             B                  F#
My heart is crammed in my cranium and it still knows how to pound 
A              E 
 Well, I found you
A       G#      F#
  Maybe you can help me
               B    G#
And I can help you
E               B                        A
This wrinkle in time, I can't give it no credit
A                  B           E             B
I thought about my space and I really got me down (got me down) 
E          B                A
 Got me so down, I got me a headache
A                          B              E                  B
 My heart is crammed in my cranium and it still knows how to pound
E            B                A 
 I Got me so down, I got me a headache
A                          B              E                  B
 My heart is crammed in my cranium and it still knows how to pound
E                B                        A
 This wrinkle in time, I can't give it no credit
A                   B           E             B
 I thought about my space and I really got me down
           E
(got me down)
