[Verse]
N.C.
Hey boy, take a look at me.   Let me dirty up your mind.
N.C.
I'll strip away your hard veneer   and see what I can find.
 
[Chorus]
N.C.                Gm                          Eb
The queerest of the queer, the strangest of the strange,
                   Cm                       F
the coldest of the cool,  the lamest of the lame,
                   Eb                       Cm
the numbest of the dumb.  I hate to see you here.
                   Eb                       N.C.
You choke behind a smile, a fake behind the fear
N.C.
The queerest of the...

[Verse]
Gm                          Eb7                       Gm       Dm
This is what he pays me for.   I'll show you how it's done.
    Gm                             Eb7                 Gm       Dm
You learn to love the pain you feel   like father, like  son.

                         Eb                              Cm
You're hungry 'cause you starve,  while holding back the tears
                Eb                       N.C.
Choking on your smile, a fake behind the fear

  I know you're dying to, (touch me, if you want)
Bbm             Gb7
  I know what's good for you, (touch me, if you want)
              F   N.C.

The coldest of the cool
                       Eb                     N.C.
You're nothing special here a fake behind the fear
