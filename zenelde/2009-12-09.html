CAPO 1st (am=bbm)

Am                                                 F
When we were young the future was so bright (Woah-oh!)
                                         C
The old neighborhood was so alive (Woah-oh!)
                                               G
And every kid on the whole damn street (Woah-oh!)

Was gonna make it big and not be beat

Am                                              F
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn (Woah-oh!)
                                                       C
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn (Woah-oh!)
                         G
How can one little street

Swallow so many lives

        Am
Chances thrown
          F
Nothing's free
        C                G
Longing for what used to be
           Am
Still it's hard
        F
Hard to see
        C                G
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

Am                                            F
Jamie had a chance, well she really did (Woah-oh!
                                                          C
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids (Woah-oh!)
                                              G
Mark still lives at home cause he's got no job

Just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot

Brandon OD'd and died (Woah-oh!)
                       
What the hell is going on
G
cruelest dream, reality

        Am
Chances thrown
          F
Nothing's free
        C                G
Longing for what used to be
           Am
Still it's hard
        F
Hard to see
        C                G
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
