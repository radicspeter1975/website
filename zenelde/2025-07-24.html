[Bm Dm Gm Bb] - repeated the whole song
 
          Bm
My little girl
         Dm
Drive anywhere
            Gm
Do what you want
Bb
I don't care
  Bm                        Dm
Tonight I'm in the hands of fate
         Gm
I hand myself 
Bb
Over on a plate
Bm  Dm  Gm  Bb
Now
 
           Bm
Oh little girl
                       Dm
There are times when I feel
             Gm
I rather not be
    Bb
The one behind the wheel
Bm
Come 
           Dm
Pull my strings
          Gm
Watch me move
      Bb
I do anything
 Bm
Please
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse]
              Bm
Sweet little girl
      Dm
I prefer 
                Gm
You behind the wheel
    Bb
And me the passenger
Bm
Drive
              Dm
I'm yours to keep
            Gm
Do what you want
    Bb
I'm going cheap
    Bm
Tonight
 
[Instrumental]
Bm   Dm   Gm   Bb
              You're behind the wheel, tonight
